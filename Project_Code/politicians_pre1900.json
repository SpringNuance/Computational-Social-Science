The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, when the Protestant monarchs William III and Mary II acceded to the British throne. Benedict Calvert made strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England.\nIn February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months.

He supported the Free Soil Party ticket of Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams Sr. in the 1848 presidential election. In 1854, in opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, he left the Democratic Party and helped establish the Republican Party. Blair served as an advisor to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. In 1861, he was sent by Lincoln to offer command of a large Union army to Colonel Robert E. Lee, who declined, and instead joined the Confederacy. Blair also helped organize the Hampton Roads Conference of 1865, a failed attempt to end the war.\nAfter the Union victory, Blair became disillusioned with Radical Reconstruction, a policy promoted by many members of the Republican Party.

His rebellious and stubborn temperament would appear as early as his high school years in Damascus, when he would be exiled several times by the Ottoman authorities for participating in school strikes against their policies in the region. In his adulthood, Tal would be imprisoned and exiled several times for democratic activism or for insulting high-ranking officials by the governments of the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and, after its downfall, by the government of the Emirate of Transjordan.\nHis first job was in Karak, Transjordan, as an Arabic literature teacher. Later Tal would be appointed as Administrative Governor of Wadi Al-Seer and Shoubak in the 1920s. After earning a law degree in 1930, he would hold several positions in the judiciary before being appointed as Chief of Protocol at the Emir's Court. Tal then was laid off from his job and imprisoned for 70 days after an altercation with a Prime Minister serving during that time. This would be the latest in a series of exiles and imprisonments he faced throughout his life. Tal became desperate and his alcoholism worsened, contributing to his death on 24 May 1949.\nTal's relationship with the nomadic Dom (gypsy) community in Transjordan, which are called Nawar in Arabic, influenced much of his poetry, whereas he named his only poetry collection, Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis, in reference to the festive nights he spent with the Nawar and to a Nawari woman he loved. Tal found justice, equality and lack of classism among the Nawari community, which he thought was lacking in Transjordan's cities. He reflected these views in many of his poems, as well as venerating the lands of Jordan, and at other times vehemently criticizing its government's policies. He also wrote poems dedicated to criticizing British policies which supported Zionism in Palestine along with British colonial officers in Transjordan, while other poems he wrote venerated alcohol and were about women.\nTal is Jordan's most celebrated poet. The country's most illustrious literary award is named after him, and his hometown of Irbid holds an annual literary festival in his name. The house where he used to live in Irbid was turned into a museum that welcomes hundreds of visitors annually. He was married four times, two of which ended in divorce. He had ten children. His eldest son Wasfi Tal was Jordan's Prime Minister for several tenures during the late 1960s and early 1970s until his assassination in 1971.", "langs": ["ar", "fa", "ur"], "links": []}, "Carlos_Alb\u00e1n": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_Alb\u00e1n", "ID": "51651", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alb\u00e1n", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' carlos alb\u00e1n ', ' alban carlos ']", "birthDate": "[' 1844-03-09 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1902-01-20 ']", "occupation": "[' science ', ' surgeon ', ' politician ', ' philosopher ', ' journalist ', ' lawyer ', ' scientificinventormedical surgeonpoliticianphilosopherjournalist andlawyer ']", "nationality": "[' colombians ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Carlos Alb\u00e1n (March 9, 1844 \u2013 January 20, 1902) was a Colombian inventor who specialized in mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and surgery.

Danton's continual criticism of the Committee of Public Safety provoked further counter-attacks. At the end of March 1794, Danton made a speech announcing the end of the Terror.

Browder was the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s.\nDuring World War I, Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region.\nIn 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for President of the United States. Browder also took part in activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence.\nIn the wake of public outrage over the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity.\nBrowder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized pressure group within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association\". However, following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Cold War and internal red scare quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands.\nBrowder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in Yonkers, New York and later in Princeton, New Jersey, where he died in 1973.

He began his political career as district attorney, soon becoming a state deputy prior to a brief departure from politics. After returning to the state Legislative Assembly, Vargas led troops during Rio Grande do Sul's 1923 civil war. He entered national politics as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. Afterward, Vargas served as Minister of Finance under President Washington Lu\u00eds before resigning to head Rio Grande do Sul as state president, during which he had an active tenure and introduced many policies.\nIn 1930, after losing the presidential election, Vargas rose to power under a provisional presidency following an armed revolution, remaining until 1934 when he was elected president under a new constitution. Three years later he seized powers under the pretext of a potential communist insurrection, beginning the eight-year long Estado Novo dictatorship.

Well-known for his oratory skills, Mirabeau quickly rose to the top of the French political hierarchy following his election to the Estates-General in 1789, and was recognized as a leader of the newly organized National Assembly. Among the revolutionaries, Mirabeau was an advocate of the moderate position of constitutional monarchy built on the model of Great Britain. He was also a leading member of the Jacobin Club.\nMirabeau died of pericarditis in 1791 and was regarded as a national hero and a father of the Revolution. He received a grand burial and was the first to be interred at the Panth\u00e9on. During the 1792 Trial of Louis XVI, the discovery that Mirabeau had secretly been in the pay of the king brought him into posthumous disgrace, and two years later his remains were removed from the Panth\u00e9on.

His extensive writings include treatises on rhetoric, philosophy and politics. He is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and served as consul in 63 BC.\nHis influence on the Latin language was immense. He wrote more than three-quarters of extant Latin literature that is known to have existed in his lifetime, and it has been said that subsequent prose was either a reaction against or a return to his style, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century. Cicero introduced into Latin the arguments of the chief schools of Hellenistic philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary with neologisms such as evidentia, humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia, distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher.\nThough he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the Catiline conspiracy attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators without trial. During the chaotic middle period of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. Following Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed on the Rostra.Petrarch's rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance in public affairs, humanism, and classical Roman culture. According to Polish historian Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski, \"the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity.\" The peak of Cicero's authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment, and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as John Locke, David Hume, Montesquieu, and Edmund Burke was substantial. His works rank among the most influential in global culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.", "langs": ["af", "als", "am", "an", "ar", "arz", "as", "ast", "av", "az", "azb", "ba", "bcl", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "br", "bs", "ca", "ceb", "ckb", "co", "cs", "cu", "cv", "cy", "da", "de", "diq", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "ext", "fa", "fi", "fr", "fur", "fy", "ga", "gl", "gom", "he", "hi", "hr", "hu", "hy", "hyw", "ia", "id", "ie", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "jv", "ka", "kbp", "kk", "km", "ko", "ku", "kw", "ky", "la", "lb", "lfn", "li", "lt", "lv", "mg", "mk", "ml", "mn", "mr", "mrj", "ms", "my", "nah", "nl", "nn", "nb", "oc", "pa", "pam", "pl", "pms", "pnb", "ps", "pt", "qu", "ro", "ru", "scn", "sco", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sq", "sr", "stq", "sv", "ta", "th", "tl", "tr", "tt", "uk", "ur", "uz", "vec", "vi", "vls", "war", "wuu", "yo", "zh", "zh-classical", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue"], "links": ["Cesare_Beccaria", "Dante_Alighieri", "Eduard_Bernstein", "Francesco_Guicciardini", "Personal_life_of_Cicero", "Pliny_the_Younger", "Political_career_of_Cicero", "Vladimir_Lenin", "Writings_of_Cicero"]}, "Joshua_Coit": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joshua_Coit", "ID": "125861", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Coit", "gender": "M", "name": "[' joshua coit ']", "birthDate": "[' 1758-10-07 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1798-09-05 ']", "occupation": "[' lawyer ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' federalist party ']", "summary": "Joshua Coit (October 7, 1758 \u2013 September 5, 1798) was an eighteenth-century American lawyer and politician.

He also became a prominent member of the Socialist Party of Canada, which at the time represented the left-wing of the labour movement in Manitoba.\nIn 1919, he attended the Western Labour Conference in Calgary, Alberta, and called for the replacement of narrow craft unionism with an industrial union known as the One Big Union.  During the Winnipeg General Strike, he became a prominent figure in the Strike Committee which managed most city affairs.\nAfter the strike was suppressed, Russell and other strike leaders were arrested on charges of seditious conspiracy.  He was the first of the strikers to go to trial, and was sentenced to a two-year term at Stony Mountain Federal Penitentiary.  Many observers at the time, and many since, have regarded the charges against the strike leaders as unjust and politically motivated.\nThe strike and the resulting arrests created a temporary climate of labour unity in the city.  The SPC had previously opposed \"popular front\" campaigns with centrist labour parties, and Russell himself had argued in 1918 that it was pointless to elect labour representatives to capitalist legislatures.  Nevertheless, the SPC agreed to participate in a \"united labour\" slate for the 1920 provincial election.  Russell, still serving a prison sentence, ran as an SPC candidate in the constituency of Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot.  He came very close to being elected, finishing ninth on the first count and missing the tenth seat by only sixty-two votes on the final tally.  Russell's fellow prisoner George Armstrong was elected for the SPC, and so became the only member of the party ever to serve in the Manitoba legislature.\nRussell also ran for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1921 federal election, contesting the single-member riding of Winnipeg North.  He finished a close second, losing to Liberal Edward James McMurray by 715 votes.\nRussell returned to labour activism following his release from prison in 1922.  He was selected as the leader of the Winnipeg's One Big Union, and held this position into the 1950s.\nHe campaigned again for the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election in the constituency of Assinboia, just west of Winnipeg.  As the SPC had folded in 1925, Russell contested this election with support from Manitoba's Independent Labour Party.  He again lost by a narrow margin, falling sixty votes behind Conservative candidate Joseph Cotter.\nIn Winnipeg, a high school named R.B. Russell Vocational High School was named in his honour.", "langs": [], "links": []}, "Arthur_Ramette": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Ramette", "ID": "147521", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ramette", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' arthur jean baptiste ramette ']", "birthDate": "[' 1897-10-12 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1988-12-15 ']", "occupation": "[' magazine editor politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Arthur Jean Baptiste Ramette (12 October 1897 \u2013 15 December 1988) was a French mechanic and communist politician.

He fought as a volunteer in the 218th infantry regiment in World War I, rising to the rank of captain, and turning down a further promotion to resume teaching. In 1918, he resumed teaching at the University of Modena, then went on to teach at the law school in Siena, and finally, in Florence. His notable works include La cassazione civile (Appellate Review of Civil Judgments) (1920) and Studi sul processo civile (1930). He also co-founded the journals Rivista di diritto processuale (1924), Il foro toscano (The Tuscan Courts) (1926) and Il Ponte (The Bridge) (1945), and participated in the 1942 revision of the Italian code of civil procedure.\nCalamandrei was highly critical of Italian fascism; he signed Benedetto Croce's 1925 Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals and was linked to the Florentine journal Non mollare! (Don't Give Up!) published between January and October 1925. After the fall of the fascist regime in 1943, the Allies named him rector of the University of Florence. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Italy in 1945 as a member of the Action Party (PdA), a liberal socialist and social liberal party, and to the Chamber of Deputies in 1948 as a member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). \nOn 4 December 1952, Calamandrei also penned the antifascist poem, Lapide ad ignominia (\"A monument to ignominy\"). The German general Albert Kesselring who was responsible for various war crimes during the Nazi occupation of Italy had been sentenced to death, a sentence that was later commuted. When Kesselring was freed, he refused to repent for his crimes and claimed the Italians ought to build him a monument for his good work there. Calamandrei responded with this poem, stating that if Kesselring returned, he would indeed find a monument but one stronger than stone and comprising Italian resistance fighters who \"willingly took up arms, to preserve dignity, not to promote hate, and who decided to fight back against the shame and terror of the world.\" Calamandrei's poem appears in monuments in the towns of Cuneo and Montepulciano.\nHe died in Florence at the age of 67.", "langs": ["arz", "ca", "de", "es", "fr", "it", "la", "pms", "pt", "scn"], "links": []}, "Sasaki_Takayuki": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sasaki_Takayuki", "ID": "152121", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasaki_Takayuki", "gender": "M", "name": "[' sasaki takayuki ']", "birthDate": "[' 1830-11-26 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1910-03-03 ']", "occupation": "[' politician cabinet minister ']", "nationality": "[' japan ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Marquis Sasaki Takayuki (\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u9ad8\u884c, November 26, 1830 \u2013 March 3, 1910) was a bureaucrat, government minister and court official in late Meiji period Japan.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "az", "ca", "de", "fa", "fr", "ja", "ko"], "links": ["Sakamoto_Ry\u014dma"]}, "Jens_Ludvig_Andersen_Aars": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jens_Ludvig_Andersen_Aars", "ID": "153155", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Ludvig_Andersen_Aars", "gender": "M", "name": "[' jens ludvig a a ']", "birthDate": "[' 1852-12-23 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1919-05-22 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "[' norway ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Jens Ludvig Andersen Aars (23 December 1852 \u2013 22 May 1919) was a Norwegian politician.\nHe was born in Horten as a son of Jens Ludvig Aars and Anette Lund, a nephew of Nils Fredrik Julius Aars and a grandson of Jens Aars.

Austin, who was an Anglo-American colonizer of Mexican Texas. As a teenager, Williams started working in the family's mercantile business in Baltimore. He spent time in South America and New Orleans, fleeing the latter because of debts. He landed in Mexican Texas in 1822, having learned French and Spanish. Stephen F. Austin hired Williams for his colony in 1824. Williams first worked as a clerk, and later assumed the title of secretary to the ayuntamiento, a local government established for the colony by the Mexican state of Coahuila and Texas.  He worked for Austin for about a decade.\nIn 1834, Williams quit as secretary of the Austin Colony to work as a merchant, then formalized a partnership with Thomas F. McKinney. The next year he also made deals with the provincial government in Monclova for a bank charter and for large tracts of land in Texas. At that time he was a representative in the Coahuila and Texas legislature. However, by 1836, Williams and his partner, Thomas F. McKinney, supported the Texas Revolution against Mexico. Williams borrowed money against his family's lines of credit, which the partners applied to ships and ammunition on behalf of the rebel government.\nAfter Texas gained independence, Williams focused most of his business activities in Galveston, and represented Galveston County for one term in the Republic of Texas legislature.  Through his partnership with McKinney he was invested in the Galveston City Company, and established diverse business interests there. The partnership ended when their business was acquired by Henry Howell Williams in 1842.\nAfter 1842, Williams worked toward establishing a bank in Texas. He briefly returned to public service when he accepted a diplomatic mission to negotiate a treaty with Mexico, which had still not recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of Texas. In the first year of Texas statehood, he ran twice for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing both times. In 1848 Williams succeeded in introducing the first bank in Texas: the Commercial & Agricultural Bank (C & A Bank).  This was the only institution to legally issue paper money, though his charter and the bank's practices faced legal challenges throughout its existence, including anti-banking legislation and scrutiny from various Texas Attorneys General. Favorable decisions rendered by the district courts saved Williams and his bank for about four years. C & A Bank remained solvent during the Panic of 1857, but anti-banking politics were on the rise. Many of Williams' friends and allies distanced themselves from the bank and encouraged him to give up the project, but he resisted their advice.

As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917 on behalf of the cabinet, which supported a \"home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine.\nEntering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.\nIn July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher's naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an alliance that ended centuries of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer War (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911.\nBalfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George's coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopher \u2013 he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth \u2013 and was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\".", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "az", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "ca", "cs", "cy", "da", "de", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "ga", "gd", "gl", "he", "hi", "hr", "hu", "hy", "id", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "ka", "kk", "ko", "kw", "la", "lmo", "lv", "mg", "mr", "ms", "nl", "nn", "nb", "oc", "pl", "ps", "pt", "ru", "sco", "sh", "simple", "sr", "sv", "tg", "tr", "uk", "ur", "vi", "wuu", "yo", "zh", "zh-yue"], "links": ["Anthony_Barber", "Edward_Heath", "Frederick_Marquis,_1st_Earl_of_Woolton"]}, "Mo\u0161a_Pijade": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mo\u0161a_Pijade", "ID": "179086", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo\u0161a_Pijade", "gender": "M", "name": "[' mo\u0161a pijade ']", "birthDate": "[' 1890-01-04 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1957-03-15 ']", "occupation": "[' painting ', ' art critic ', ' publicist ', ' revolutionary ', ' resistance during world war ii ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' yugoslavs ']", "party": "[' league of communists of yugoslavia ']", "summary": "Mo\u0161a Pijade (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041co\u0448a \u041f\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0434\u0435; Hebrew: \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d9\u05d0\u05d3\u05d4; alternate English transliteration Moshe Piade; 4 January 1890 \u2013 15 March 1957), nicknamed \u010ci\u010da Janko (\u0427\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0408\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e, lit. \"Old Man Janko\") was a  Serbian and Yugoslav communist of Jewish origin, a close collaborator of Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslav politician, and full member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.", "langs": ["arz", "bg", "bs", "cs", "de", "es", "fr", "he", "hr", "hu", "it", "ja", "mk", "nl", "pl", "ru", "sh", "sl", "sr", "sv", "zh"], "links": ["Josip_Broz_Tito"]}, "Christopher_Gadsden": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Gadsden", "ID": "179220", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Gadsden", "gender": "M", "name": "[' christopher gadsden ']", "birthDate": "[' 1724-02-16 ']", "deathDate": "[' 2016-02-05 ']", "occupation": "[' american politician and general ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Christopher Gadsden (February 16, 1724 \u2013 August 28, 1805) was an American politician who was the principal leader of the South Carolina Patriot movement during the American Revolution.

He participated in the Khilafat Movement in his early youth. A strong advocate of peasant rights, disappointed by the Congress's negligence to Muslim peasants, like many other Muslim Congress workers of Bengal, he left the Congress and founded the Praja Samity (later the Krishak-Praja Samity), a peasant welfare organisation and its political arm the Krishak-Praja Party (KPP). He became a major organiser of the KPP in the greater Mymensingh district region. As the KPP president A K Fazlul Huq took office as the first prime minister of Bengal, after the 1937 provincial elections, Ahmad became one of his closest confidantes. Disheartened by KPP's failure in the government, he inclined towards the thriving Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement in the early 1940s. He realised that Pakistan is inevitable and urged the KPP workers to join the Muslim League, fearing a feudal elite and clergy domination in its leadership.\nAhmad was dismayed by the Muslim League government in East Pakistan. He joined the Awami Muslim League (later the Awami League), a dissident offshoot of the Muslim League. He proposed the Jukta Front coalition for the 1954 provincial elections and also authored its 21-points election manifesto. The Jukta Front won a landslide victory in the election and he was elected to the legislative assembly. He was a major critic of the Pakistan Constitution assembly debate in 1956. He served as the Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Suhrawardy cabinet of the central Government of Pakistan, also occasionally serving as the acting prime minister.\nAhmad was an author of stories, novels, and political satires. He also wrote extensively on politics, culture, and history. He argued that despite sharing the same Bengali language, Muslims of Bengal, primarily in East Bengal (often referred by him as 'Muslim Bengal'), had developed and cultivated a distinct Perso-Arabic-influenced Bengali Muslim culture in parallel to the Hindu culture cultivated by the Hindus of Bengal. In his writings, he used the East Bengal dialect of Bengali and the Perso-Arabic words used by the Muslims of Bengal, for which he suffered discrimination on occasions. He saw Pakistan as an opportunity for flourishing East Bengal's culture. As a member of the Pakistan Renaissance Society, he provided a vision for East Bengal's literary ideal.\nAs a journalist and politician, Ahmad observed and was involved in many crucial political events of Bengal and India at large. At different stages of his career, he was a confidante to many leading political figures of Bengal, including A K Fazlul Huq, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. He was an important intermediary in many political arbitrations. His magnum opus Amar Dekha Rajneetir Panchash Bachhar (Fifty Years of Politics As I Saw It) (1969) is a first-hand chronicle and a critique of the politics of Bengal spanning his career.\nHe was awarded the Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1960 and the Independence Day Award in 1979 by the Government of Bangladesh.", "langs": ["arz", "bn", "es", "fa", "fr", "id", "ur"], "links": []}, "Heinrich_B\u00f6schen": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_B\u00f6schen", "ID": "185708", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_B\u00f6schen", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' heinrich b\u00f6schen ', ' b\u00f6schen heinrich ']", "birthDate": "[' 1887-10-27 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1945-12-31 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' social democratic party of germany ', ' independent social democratic party of germany ', ' communist party of germany ']", "summary": "Heinrich B\u00f6schen (born 27 October 1887; presumed to have died following disappearance on 31 December 1945) was a German Communist politician and trades unionist.During the Nazi period he was detained by the state: by the end of the war he and disappeared.

He also served as an official in the Confederate States of America.\nBorn and educated in Georgia, he moved to Oxford, Mississippi, to establish a legal practice. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1856 and served until January 1861, when he helped draft Mississippi's Ordinance of Secession. He helped raise the 19th Mississippi Infantry Regiment and worked on the staff of his wife's cousin, General James Longstreet. In 1862, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Lamar to the position of Confederate minister to Russia. Following the Civil War, Lamar taught at the University of Mississippi and was a delegate to several state constitutional conventions.\nLamar returned to the United States House of Representatives in 1873, becoming the first Mississippi Democrat elected to the House since the end of the Civil War. He remained in the House until 1877, and represented Mississippi in the Senate from 1877 to 1885.

During World War II, he was the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in German-occupied Europe. He also served as the president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 14 January 1953 until his death on 4 May 1980. Ideologically, Tito\u2019s developments to communist ideology are known as Titoism.\nHe was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec, Austria-Hungary (now in Croatia). Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Russians during World War I, he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains. He participated in some events of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the subsequent Civil War. Upon his return to the Balkans in 1918, he entered the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). Having assumed de facto control over the party by 1937, he was formally elected its general secretary in 1939 and later its president, the title he held until his death. During World War II, after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941\u20131945). By the end of the war, the Partisans\u2014with the backing of the invading Soviet Union\u2014took power over Yugoslavia.\nAfter the war, Tito was the chief architect of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), serving as the prime minister (1944\u20131963), president (1953\u20131980; since 1974 president for life), and marshal of Yugoslavia, the highest rank of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). Despite being one of the founders of Cominform, he became the first Cominform member to defy Soviet hegemony in 1948. He was the only leader in Joseph Stalin's lifetime to leave Cominform and begin with his country's own socialist program, which contained elements of market socialism. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born Jaroslav Van\u011bk and Yugoslav-born Branko Horvat, promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the Illyrian model. Firms were socially owned by their employees and structured on workers' self-management; they competed in open and free markets. Tito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by gradually delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution defined SFR Yugoslavia as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of brotherhood and unity in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to self-determination and secession if done through legal channels. Lastly, Tito gave Kosovo and Vojvodina, the two constituent provinces of Serbia, substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the Yugoslav parliament. Tito built a very powerful cult of personality around himself, which was maintained by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia even after his death. Twelve years after his death, as communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia dissolved and descended into a series of interethnic wars.\nSome historians criticise Tito's presidency as authoritarian and see him as a dictator, and others characterise him as a benevolent dictator\u2014designations that are not mutually exclusive. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, alongside Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, and Sukarno of Indonesia. With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both Cold War blocs, he received a total of 98 foreign decorations, including the Legion of Honour and the Order of the Bath.", "langs": ["af", "an", "ar", "arz", "ast", "az", "ba", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "br", "bs", "ca", "cs", "cy", "da", "de", "dsb", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "fur", "fy", "ga", "gd", "gl", "he", "hi", "hr", "hsb", "hu", "hy", "id", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "ka", "km", "ko", "ku", "ky", "la", "lb", "lfn", "lo", "lt", "lv", "mg", "mk", "ml", "mn", "mr", "ms", "my", "mzn", "ne", "nl", "nn", "nb", "nov", "oc", "pa", "pl", "pnb", "ps", "pt", "qu", "ro", "ru", "rue", "sc", "scn", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sq", "sr", "sv", "ta", "tg", "th", "tl", "tr", "tt", "uk", "ur", "uz", "vec", "vi", "war", "wuu", "yo", "zh", "zh-yue"], "links": ["Ante_Paveli\u0107", "Clara_Zetkin", "Du\u0161an_Simovi\u0107", "Eduard_Bernstein", "Fadil_Hoxha", "Ivan_Ribar", "Mihajlo_Apostolski", "Mo\u0161a_Pijade", "Rade_Kon\u010dar", "Slobodan_Jovanovi\u0107", "Vladimir_Lenin"]}, "Charles_de_Verninac": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_de_Verninac", "ID": "195380", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Verninac", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' henri-fran\u00e7ois-charles de verninac de saint-maur ', ' verninac de saint-maur henri-francois-charles de ']", "birthDate": "[' 1841-05-18 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1901-05-12 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Henri-Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Verninac de Saint-Maur (18 May 1841 \u2013 12 May 1901) was a French politician who was a Senator from 1883 until his death in 1901.", "langs": ["fr"], "links": []}, "Jos\u00e9_de_Diego": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jos\u00e9_de_Diego", "ID": "196246", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_de_Diego", "gender": "M", "name": "[' jos\u00e9 de diego ']", "birthDate": "[' 1866-04-16 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1918-07-16 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "[' puerto ricans ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Jos\u00e9 de Diego y Mart\u00ednez (April 16, 1866 \u2013 July 16, 1918) was a statesman, journalist, poet, lawyer, and advocate for Puerto Rico's political autonomy in union with Spain and later of independence from the United States who was referred to by his peers as \"The Father of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement\".", "langs": ["arz", "de", "es", "fr", "pt"], "links": ["Antonio_Mattei_Lluberas", "Eduardo_Georgetti", "Jos\u00e9_Gualberto_Padilla", "Jos\u00e9_M._D\u00e1vila_Monsanto", "Luis_Llor\u00e9ns_Torres", "Luis_Mu\u00f1oz_Rivera", "Manuel_Rodr\u00edguez_Orellana", "Ram\u00f3n_Emeterio_Betances", "Rosendo_Matienzo_Cintr\u00f3n"]}, "Vinson_Allen_Collins": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vinson_Allen_Collins", "ID": "196415", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinson_Allen_Collins", "gender": "M", "name": "[' vinson allen collins ', ' collins vinson allen ']", "birthDate": "[' 1867-03-01 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1966-07-05 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ', ' schoolteacher lawyer politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' democratic party (united states) ']", "summary": "Vinson Allen Collins (March 1, 1867 - July 5, 1966) was a Texas politician.", "langs": ["arz"], "links": []}, "Leopold_De_Wael": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_De_Wael", "ID": "196881", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_De_Wael", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' de wael leopold ']", "birthDate": "[' 1823-07-14 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1892-08-17 ']", "occupation": "[' politician merchant ']", "nationality": "[' belgium ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "L\u00e9opold Charles Norbert De Wael (14 July 1823 \u2013 17 August 1892) was a Belgian merchant and liberal politician.\nHe was mayor of Antwerp, member of the provincial council of Antwerp and a Member of Parliament.

His Menier Chocolate company purchased cocoa-growing estates in Nicaragua and sugar beet fields in France, erected a processing mill, and equipped itself in other ways for the production of chocolate on a large scale.

Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and Roman constitutionalist, played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. A contemporary of Julius Caesar, Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.Cicero is generally perceived to be one of the most versatile minds of ancient Rome. He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary, distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher.  An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters to Atticus contained such a wealth of detail \"concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government\" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.During the chaotic middle period of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. \"Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!\" wrote C.

Above all, the elimination of slavery; so many fugitive slaves came to Peterboro to ask for his help (usually, in reaching Canada) that there is a book about them. Peterboro was, because of him; the capital of the abolition movement; the only assembly of escaped slaves (as opposed to free Blacks) ever to meet in the United States\u2014the Fugitive Slave Convention of 1850\u2014took place in neighboring Cazenovia because Peterboro was too small for the meeting.\nSmith was also, and less successfully, a temperance activist, and a women's rights suffrage advocate. He was a significant financial contributor to the Liberty Party and the Republican Party throughout his life. Besides making substantial donations of both land and money to create Timbuctoo, an African-American community in North Elba, New York, he was involved in the temperance movement and the colonization movement, before abandoning colonization in favor of abolitionism, the immediate freeing of all the slaves.

For nearly two decades from the early 1930s, he served as a judge in courts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Entering the U.S. Navy during World War II, he served in the military justice system.\nFollowing the war, in 1946, Musmanno served as military governor of an occupied district in Italy. Beginning in 1947, he served as a presiding judge for the Einsatzgruppen trial in U.S. military court at Nuremberg. In 1948, he conducted interviews with several people who had worked closely with Adolf Hitler. In 1950, he published a book based on his research, in which he argued that Hitler had indeed committed suicide in Berlin in 1945.\nIn 1951, Musmanno was elected as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, where he served until his death in 1968. He set a record for the number of dissenting opinions filed. In addition to his long judicial career and postwar contributions in Europe, he wrote sixteen books and many articles related to his court cases and professional career. In his writing he expressed sympathy for working men and deep interest in the Italians in the United States, himself having Italian ancestry.\nViewed as a \"maverick on the court\", Musmanno was known for defending Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as for being anti-Communist, and for supporting civil rights. In 1966, in response to new evidence of the Norse colonization of North America (c.\u20091000), he published a book in which he argued that Christopher Columbus was the first European to discover the Americas.

Although he was not from the state of Sonora, whose revolutionary generals dominated Mexican politics in the 1920s, C\u00e1rdenas was hand-picked by Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, Sonoran general and former president of Mexico, as a presidential candidate and won in the 1934 general election.\nAfter founding the National Revolutionary Party (PNR) in the wake of the assassination of president-elect \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles had unofficially remained in power during the Maximato (1928\u20131934) and expected to maintain that role when C\u00e1rdenas took office. C\u00e1rdenas, however, out-maneuvered him politically and forced Calles into exile. He established the structure of the National Revolutionary Party, eventually renamed the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM), on the sectoral representation of peasant leagues, labor union confederations, and the Mexican Army. C\u00e1rdenas's incorporation of the army into the party structure was a deliberate move to diminish the power of the military and prevent their intervention in politics through coups d'\u00e9tat.\nA left-wing economic nationalist, C\u00e1rdenas led the expropriation of the Mexican oil industry and the creation of the state-owned oil company Pemex in 1938. He implemented large-scale land reform programs in Mexico, redistributing large estates to smallholders in lands termed ejidos. He created the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) and El Colegio de M\u00e9xico (Colmex). His foreign policy supported and gave asylum to Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.

A liberal reformer influenced by the Age of Enlightenment, Pombal led Portugal's recovery from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and modernized the kingdom's administrative, economic, and ecclesiastical institutions. During his lengthy ministerial career, Pombal accumulated and exercised autocratic power.\nThe son of a country squire and nephew of a prominent cleric, Pombal studied at the University of Coimbra before enlisting in the Portuguese Army, where he reached the rank of corporal. Pombal subsequently returned to academic life in Lisbon, but retired to his family's estates in 1733 after eloping with a nobleman's niece. In 1738, with his uncle's assistance, he secured an appointment as King John V's ambassador to Great Britain. In 1745, he was named ambassador to Austria and served until 1749. When Joseph I acceded to the throne in 1750, Pombal was appointed as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. \nDespite entrenched opposition from the hereditary Portuguese nobility, Pombal gained Joseph's confidence and, by 1755, was the king's de facto chief minister. Pombal secured his preeminence through his decisive management of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one of the deadliest earthquakes in history; he maintained public order, organized relief efforts, and supervised the capital's reconstruction in the Pombaline architectural style. Pombal was appointed as Secretary of State for Internal Affairs in 1757 and consolidated his authority during the T\u00e1vora affair of 1759, which resulted in the execution of leading members of the aristocratic party and allowed Pombal to suppress the Society of Jesus. In 1759, Joseph granted Pombal the title of Count of Oeiras and, in 1769, that of Marquis of Pombal.\nA leading estrangeirado strongly influenced by his observations of British commercial and domestic policy, Pombal implemented sweeping commercial reforms, establishing a system of companies and guilds governing each industry. These efforts included the demarcation of the Douro wine region, created to regulate the production and trade of port wine. In foreign policy, although Pombal desired to decrease Portuguese reliance on Great Britain, he maintained the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, which successfully defended Portugal from Spanish invasion during the Seven Years' War. Pombal enacted liberal domestic policies, including the prohibition of the import of black slaves within Portugal and Portuguese India, and greatly weakened the Portuguese Inquisition,  and granting civil rights to the New Christians. Despite these reforms, Pombal governed autocratically, curtailing individual liberties, suppressing political opposition, and fostered the slave trade to Brazil.  Following the accession of Queen Maria I in 1777, Pombal was stripped of his offices and ultimately exiled to his estates, where he died in 1782.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "bg", "ca", "cs", "de", "eo", "es", "eu", "fi", "fr", "gl", "he", "id", "it", "ja", "ko", "la", "lt", "mr", "mwl", "nl", "nb", "oc", "os", "pl", "pt", "ru", "sc", "sco", "sl", "sv", "tr", "uk", "zh"], "links": ["Tom\u00e1s_Xavier_de_Lima_Teles_da_Silva,_1st_Marquis_of_Ponte_de_Lima"]}, "Luigj_Bum\u00e7i": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luigj_Bum\u00e7i", "ID": "386585", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigj_Bum\u00e7i", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' luigj bum\u00e7i ', ' bum\u00e7i luigj ']", "birthDate": "[' 1872-11-07 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1945-03-01 ']", "occupation": "[' catholic priest bishop politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Luigj Bum\u00e7i (7 November 1872 \u2013 1 March 1945) was an Albanian Catholic religious and political figure.", "langs": ["arz", "fi", "fr", "hu", "pl", "sq", "sv"], "links": ["Aqif_Pasha_Elbasani"]}, "Niko_Nikoladze": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Niko_Nikoladze", "ID": "388044", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Nikoladze", "gender": "M", "name": "[' niko nikoladze ', ' nikoladze niko ']", "birthDate": "[' 1843-09-27 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1928-06-05 ']", "occupation": "[' poet ', ' intellectual ', ' politician ', ' prince ']", "nationality": "[' georgians ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Niko Nikoladze (Georgian: \u10dc\u10d8\u10d9\u10dd \u10dc\u10d8\u10d9\u10dd\u10da\u10d0\u10eb\u10d4) (27 September 1843 \u2013 5 June 1928) was a Georgian writer, pro-Western enlightener, and public figure primarily known for his contributions to the development of Georgian liberal journalism and his involvement in various economic and social projects of that time.", "langs": ["arz", "az", "bg", "ka", "ru", "uk"], "links": []}, "Heinrich_Schmitt": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Schmitt", "ID": "388250", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schmitt", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' heinrich schmitt ']", "birthDate": "[' 1895-10-06 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1951-08-13 ']", "occupation": "[' trades union activist & politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' social democratic party of germany ', ' independent social democratic party of germany ', ' communist party of germany ']", "summary": "Heinrich Schmitt (6 October 1895 \u2013 13 August 1951) was a German politician.

The sisters lived together as adults, while Angelina was the wife of abolitionist leader Theodore Dwight Weld.\nAlthough raised in Charleston, South Carolina, Angelina and Sarah spent their entire adult lives in the North. Angelina's greatest fame was between 1835, when William Lloyd Garrison published a letter of hers in his anti-slavery newspaper The Liberator, and May 1838, when she gave a speech to abolitionists with a hostile, noisy, stone-throwing crowd outside Pennsylvania Hall. The essays and speeches she produced in that period were incisive arguments to end slavery and to advance women's rights.\nDrawing her views from natural rights theory (as set forth in the Declaration of Independence), the United States Constitution, Christian beliefs in the Bible, and her own childhood memories of the cruel slavery and racism in the South, Grimk\u00e9 proclaimed the injustice of denying freedom to any man or woman. When challenged for speaking in public to mixed audiences of men and women in 1837, she and her sister Sarah fiercely defended women's right to make speeches and participate in political discourse.\nIn May 1838, Angelina married Theodore Dwight Weld, a prominent abolitionist; see The abolitionist Weld\u2013Grimk\u00e9 wedding.

After the First World War served as German propaganda chief throughout the Upper Silesia plebiscite. Lukaschek headed a committee that investigated all possibilities to engage in plebiscite propaganda.

Born in Augusta, Maine, and reared by foster parents on a farm, Hume moved at age 18 to San Francisco to join a salmon-canning business started by two of his brothers. They later re-located to Astoria on the Columbia River, where they prospered. After the death of his first wife and their two young children, Hume moved again and started anew in Gold Beach, at the mouth of the Rogue.\nIn 1877 Hume bought rights to a Rogue River fishery, then built a salmon cannery and many other structures and acquired all of the tidelands bordering the lower 12 miles (19 km) of the river. He remarried, invested in a small fleet of ships and a salmon hatchery and expanded his business interests to include a store, hotel, newspaper, and many other enterprises in Gold Beach and in the nearby community of Wedderburn, which he founded. Canning, shipping, and selling hundreds of tons of salmon over the years, he became known as the Salmon King of Oregon.\nHume often wrote editorials, engaged in litigation, appealed to legislators, and waged political campaigns to protect his business interests. Running as a Republican, he was twice elected, in 1900 and 1902, to represent Coos and Curry counties in the Oregon House of Representatives. According to his biographer, he voted self-interest first and conservative positions second, resisting Populist ideas in vogue at the time.\nAmong his publications were a series of articles about fish management, collected and reprinted as Salmon of the Pacific Coast in 1893. Despite his efforts to maintain a steady fish supply through egg-collecting and fish-rearing, salmon catches on the Rogue, rising in some years and falling in others, generally declined over time.

He came of a family of small farmer proprietors, who had held land during three centuries. He was intended for the priesthood and entered the seminary of Floreffe, but his energies claimed a more active sphere.He left the monastery for the University of Louvain. Here he studied law, and also prepared himself for the military examinations. At that juncture the first Carlist War broke out, and Lambermont hastened to the scene of action to support catholicism and absolutism. His services were accepted (April 1838) and he was entrusted with the command of two small cannon. He also acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Durando. He greatly distinguished himself, and for his intrepidity on one occasion he was decorated with the Cross of the highest military Royal Military Order of Saint Ferdinand.Returning to Belgium he entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1842. He served in this department sixty-three years. He was closely associated with several of the most important questions in Belgian history during the last half of the 19th century, notably the freeing of the Scheldt. He was one of the first Belgians to see the importance of developing the trade of their country, and at his own request he was attached to the commercial branch of the foreign office. The tolls imposed by the Dutch on navigation on the Scheldt strangled Belgian trade, for Antwerp was the only port of the country. The Dutch had the right to make this levy under treaties going back to the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648, and they clung to it still more tenaciously after Belgium separated herself in 1830-1831 from the united kingdom of the Netherlands, the London Conference in 1839 fixing the toll payable to Holland at 1.5 florins (3s.) per ton.From 1856 to 1863 Lambermont devoted most of his energies to the removal of this impediment. In 1856 he drew up a plan of action, and he prosecuted it with untiring perseverance until he saw it embodied in an international convention seven years later. Twenty-one powers and states attended a conference held on the question at Brussels in 1863, and on 15 July the treaty freeing the Scheldt was signed. For this achievement Lambermont was made a baron. Among other important conferences in which Lambermont took a leading part were those of Brussels (1874) on the usages of war, Berlin (1884\u20131885) on Africa and the Congo region, and Brussels (1890) of Central African affairs and the slave trade.

In 1923 he singlehandedly altered the Christian church landscape in Bunyore and the rest of North Nyanza region\u2014in the present-day western and Nyanza regions of Kenya. He was an indomitable adept all-around crusader for a myriad of polygonal causes\u2014the rights of the aboriginal peoples, a stalwart advocate for the syncretism of Christianity and traditional African cultural moralities, and a literacy champion\u2014in the British East African Protectorate & Colony of Kenya, during the period that span more than five decades (1910s \u2013 1960s) of the colonial and postcolonial epoch.In 1952 \u2013 1957 he was detained at Kapenguria together with Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and other fellow Kenyan freedom fighters reminiscent of Chief Koinange Wa Mbiyu (d. 1960) by the British colonial government in Kenya, under the so-called emergency rule. Besides, he endured unadulterated torture, denied legal representation and visitation by his family and confr\u00e8res; and he bore the arrogation of all his business enterprises, financial, and real-estate property, confiscated as a penal measure by the colonial authorities.  In the early 1930s Esau Oriedo and Jeremiah Othuoni (1898 \u2013 c. 1958) of Enyaita successfully, through forceful civil disobedience, advocated for the chieftainship of Bunyore; in what was one of the earliest successful self-determination local movement uprising directed principally against the provincial colonial government in British East Africa.  Before that, Bunyore was still under the jurisdiction of the Paramount Chief, Nabongo Mumia of Wanga (d. 1949). Mumia had in 1926 been appointed, by the British colonial government, paramount chief of all four traditionally aligned districts of western Kenya; which included the people of Bunyore.  He was one of the first two council members from Bunyore to serve as a district representative in the colonial era District House Assembly known as the Local Native Council (LNC) of North Nyanza; one of the 26 countrywide local native legislative units enacted by the colonial government in 1924.   Additionally, serving a tenure as the council's chairperson. His aptly articulative adept championing of secular education led to the North Nyanza LNC secular education initiative that gave rise to the founding of the Government African School Kakamega, present-day Kakamega High School; the first secular secondary school and the impetus of the modern-day public education system in Kenya. Esau Oriedo went on to be elected to multiple terms as a councilman in the County Council of Kakamega in the nascent post-colonial Kenya, before voluntarily stepping down to pave way for the younger generation, whom he continued to coach and mentor. In 1964 he successfully spearheaded the election to the national parliament of Edward Eric Khasakhala, the first member of parliament (MP) from Bunyore.As a stalwart Christian crusader, Esau Oriedo is accredited among the native Africans whose contribution facilitated the growth and the headway of the modern Christian church into the interior of the African continent, dating 1450 \u2013 1950. He and Chief Otieno wa Andale of Bunyore were principal aborigines ascribed with the successful growth of the Church of God Kima Mission\u2014in its post 1904 infancy.  He adeptly teamed up with Daniel Asiachi, on a project sanctioned by the American Bible Society and with the guidance of Dr. Gertrude B. Kramer, in the first ever translation of the Bible\u2014New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs\u2014into the Nyole language.  His resolute crusading for the syncretism of Christianity and the native African values prompted him, in 1923, to forsake the Church of God Kima Mission. In 1924, Esau Oriedo with the full backing of the Archdeacon of Uganda and Kavirondo, W. E. Owen, went on to found the St. John's Anglican Church at Ebwali village in Bunyore under the auspices of the Church Mission Society.  This brought an end to the Church of God's dominance in Bunyore; thusly, Bunyore became, to this day, the pillar of strength of the Anglican Church.Esau Oriedo was an ardent pan-ethnic philanthropist and a literacy advocate who awarded a multitude of pan-ethnic bursaries to aboriginal students from underprivileged communities and families who could not afford to pay fees to attend school.  Recipients included politician Tom Mboya (d. 1969) and other notable Kenyans.  The auspiciousness of his bursaries promoted him to successfully lobby the implementation of the North Nyanza LNC Scholarship Fund. The archetypical recipient of the North Nyanza LNC scholarships was Arthur Okwemba; a cerebrally brilliant young man who went to study medicine at Makerere Medical School.

Following on from his early life, during which he had become devoted to the cause of revolution against the Tsarist regime in the Russian Empire and converted to Marxism, Lenin moved to St. Petersburg. There he joined a revolutionary cell, and became a vocal advocate for Marxism within the revolutionary socialist movement. Entering a relationship with fellow Marxist Nadezhda Krupskaya, he toured Western Europe to build ties with other Russian revolutionary emigres and learn more about the international Marxist movement. Upon returning to Russia, he was arrested for sedition in 1895 and exiled to  Shushenskoye in the Minusinsky District of eastern Siberia for three years. There, he devoted his time to translating and writing revolutionary texts, marrying Krupskaya in July 1898.\nHis exile over, in 1900 he moved to Western Europe, where he joined the editorial board of Iskra, the publication of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Iskra's base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1903, a major schism erupted between Lenin and his supporters (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov and his supporters (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled largely by the leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.\nLiving in Paris and then Krakow, he focused on internal conflict within the Marxist movement, opposing the ideas of the Mensheviks and Alexander Bogdanov; he penned Materialism and Empirio-criticism to counter his critics. During the First World War, he relocated to Switzerland, where he argued that socialists should work toward converting that \"imperialist war\" into a continent-wide \"civil war\" in which the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie. He summarised his thought in the book Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism and also re-interpreted Marxism on the basis of reading Hegelian philosophy. When the February Revolution of 1917 led to the abdication of the Tsar and the development of the Russian Provisional Government, Lenin returned to St. Petersburg, now called Petrograd.

In October 1891 Mathews was appointed First Minister to the Zanzibar government, a position in which he was \"irremovable by the sultan\". During this time Mathews was a keen abolitionist and promoted this cause to the Sultans he worked with.

His writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under Ottoman rule.\nBorn in Travnik in Austria-Hungary, modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andri\u0107 attended high school in Sarajevo, where he became an active member of several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andri\u0107 was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his PhD. in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andri\u0107 returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including Na Drini \u0107uprija (The Bridge on the Drina).\nFollowing the war, Andri\u0107 was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E. M. Forster. The Committee cited \"the epic force with which he ... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\". Afterwards, Andri\u0107's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andri\u0107's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.\nIn the years following Andri\u0107's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andri\u0107. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andri\u0107 was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community at the start of the 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature.", "langs": ["an", "ar", "arz", "avk", "az", "azb", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "br", "bs", "bxr", "ca", "cs", "cy", "da", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "ga", "gd", "gl", "gom", "hak", "he", "hi", "hr", "hsb", "hu", "hy", "ia", "id", "ilo", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "jv", "ka", "kk", "kn", "ko", "ku", "la", "lt", "lv", "mk", "mr", "ms", "nl", "nn", "nb", "oc", "pa", "pl", "pms", "pnb", "pt", "ro", "ru", "sah", "sh", "sk", "sl", "sq", "sr", "sv", "sw", "tg", "tr", "tt", "uk", "ur", "uz", "vi", "wuu", "xmf", "yo", "zh", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue"], "links": ["Josip_Broz_Tito", "Jovan_Suboti\u0107", "Slobodan_Jovanovi\u0107", "Stojan_Novakovi\u0107"]}, "William_W._Cocks": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_W._Cocks", "ID": "466092", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_W._Cocks", "gender": "M", "name": "[' william w cocks ', ' cocks william w ']", "birthDate": "[' 1861-07-24 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1932-05-24 ']", "occupation": "[' american politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "William Willets Cocks (July 24, 1861 \u2013 May 24, 1932) was an American politician who served three terms as from New York from 1905 to 1911.", "langs": ["azb", "de"], "links": ["William_H._Flack"]}, "Gustave_Rouland": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustave_Rouland", "ID": "466953", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Rouland", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' gustave rouland ', ' rouland gustave ']", "birthDate": "[' 1806-02-03 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1878-12-12 ']", "occupation": "[' magistrate and politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Gustave Rouland (3 February 1806 \u2013 12 December 1878) was a French lawyer and politician.

Bowman (March 28, 1874 \u2013 April 20, 1949) was an American self-described capitalist. He was also an entrepreneur, speculator, casino owner, and one of the founders of the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.\nBowman was the son of a Virginian Confederate cavalry veteran and expert telegraph operator who settled in West Point, Mississippi following the war. In 1887, the family moved to Childress, Texas, where they engaged in farming and ranching.(citation1)\nIn 1894, at the age of 20, Wirt Bowman became a telegraph operator and station agent for the Southern Pacific Railway. During his 18 years with the railroad, it was said that he worked at every station between Nogales and Guaymas, except for Santa Ana. (citation 2) On June 3, 1896, he married his first wife, Magdalene Bernaldo, in Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico. They had four children, Matilda Ruth Bowman, born March 27, 1897; Edna Bowman Cavanaugh, born March 24, 1900; Georgia Bowman, born February 22, 1914, died August 14, 1918 from burns; and Betty Jean Bowman (adopted) born January 19, 1918, died, October 12, 1973 from cancer. He left the railroad in 1912 to devote his time to ranching in Nogales, Arizona, where he soon became an exceptionally successful businessman and politician.  Bowman was a resident of Nogales for 51 years, and was responsible for much of its development and construction, including the Bowman Hotel and the Nogales Theater.  He eventually owned the First National Bank, and was a principal investor in the Arizona Brewing Company in Phoenix, which offered Sunbru, the first bottled beer sold in Arizona when Prohibition ended.  Bowman also purchased large amounts of land in Arizona and southern California, particularly several noted properties in San Diego (including Rancho de los Penasquitos  and Otero Ranch).\nBowman's success in business was matched by his success in politics. In Nogales, he served three terms as a town councilman, one term as mayor, (1918\u20131919) and one term as a member of the Arizona state legislature (1919\u20131920).  He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in New York City in 1924, served as vice-Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee in Arizona (1924), and served as Democratic National Committeeman of Arizona (1932\u20131940).  He was appointed Collector of Customs for the District of Arizona by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 (some say as a reward for party service) and served 2\u00bd years. (citation 7)\nBowman was also extremely successful in business ventures across the Mexican border, where he owned the Foreign Club, a Tijuana gambling establishment.  In 1928, Wirt Bowman, Baron H. Long (a California hotel and nightclub owner), and James N. Crofton (in the horseracing business) formed a company (\"syndicate\") to build the $10 million Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel.  Some sources note the fourth partner was Abelardo L. Rodriguez, Military Commander and Governor of Baja, and future President of Mexico.  The luxury Resort included casino, hotel, guest bungalows, championship golf and tennis facilities, Turkish baths, restaurants, nightclubs, and its own airstrip. The venture was enormously successful financially and particularly popular with Hollywood stars of the day, who were able to avoid Prohibition and other limitations by crossing the border.  The $2.5 million Agua Caliente racetrack, which opened in December 1929, was equally attractive because betting on horse races was illegal in California at the time.  The world of casinos, gambling, and horseracing is often associated with organized crime, as well as \"vice\" crimes, such as prostitution.  Some sources suggest that Bowman and his associates (dubbed \"Border Barons\" by the media) were also involved in these less legitimate enterprises in Tijuana, and imply that Bowman may have played a leadership role, thanks to his vast network of family and business associates on both sides of the border. (citation 11, 12)  Bowman left Agua Caliente in 1934, just one year before Mexican President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas outlawed gambling, closed the resort, and turned it into a school.\nIn 1945, Bowman sold the First National Bank, resigned as president of the local chamber of commerce, and bought one of the largest cattle ranches in southern Arizona's San Rafael Valley. (citation 2)  He died of a heart attack on April 20, 1949, at the age of 75.  He spent his last three years in Tucson, with his second wife, Teresa Villagran Bowman. He had three children with Teresa Bowman.\nBowman's associate Baron Long once owned a racehorse named \"Wirt Bowman\" that had the distinction of being the first horse transported by airplane for a horse race.", "langs": ["ar", "arz"], "links": ["L\u00e1zaro_C\u00e1rdenas"]}, "Robert_Darcy,_4th_Earl_of_Holderness": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Darcy,_4th_Earl_of_Holderness", "ID": "500887", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Darcy,_4th_Earl_of_Holderness", "gender": "M", "name": "[' the earl of holderness ']", "birthDate": "[' 1718-05-17 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1778-05-16 ']", "occupation": "[' diplomat ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' kingdom of great britain ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness,  (17 May 1718 \u2013 16 May 1778), known before 1721 as Lord Darcy and Conyers, was a British diplomat and politician.", "langs": ["cs", "de", "fr", "ja", "pl"], "links": []}, "Abraham_Garrod_Thomas": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham_Garrod_Thomas", "ID": "501319", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Garrod_Thomas", "gender": "M", "name": "[' abraham garrod thomas ', ' thomas abraham garrod ']", "birthDate": "[' 1853-10-05 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1931-01-30 ']", "occupation": "[' * politician ']", "nationality": "[' welsh people ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Sir Abraham Garrod Thomas (5 October 1853 \u2013 30 January 1931) was a Welsh physician, philanthropist, magistrate, politician and Member of Parliament.", "langs": ["arz", "cy"], "links": []}, "Ante_Paveli\u0107": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ante_Paveli\u0107", "ID": "501417", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Paveli\u0107", "gender": "M", "name": "[' ante paveli\u0107 ']", "birthDate": "[' 1889-07-14 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1959-12-28 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "[' croats ']", "party": "[' usta\u0161e ']", "summary": "Ante Paveli\u0107 (Croatian pronunciation: [\u01ce\u02d0nte p\u01ce\u028belit\u0361\u0255] (listen); 14 July 1889 \u2013 28 December 1959) was a Croatian politician who founded and headed the fascist ultranationalist organization known as the Usta\u0161e in 1929 and served as dictator of the Independent State of Croatia (Croatian: Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH), a fascist puppet state built out of parts of occupied Yugoslavia by the authorities of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, from 1941 to 1945. Paveli\u0107 and the Usta\u0161e persecuted many racial minorities and political opponents in the NDH during the war, including Serbs, Jews, Romani, and anti-fascists, becoming one of the key figures of the genocide of Serbs, the Porajmos and the Holocaust in the NDH.At the start of his career, Paveli\u0107 was a lawyer and a politician of the Croatian Party of Rights in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia known for his nationalist beliefs and support for an independent Croatia. By the end of the 1920s, his political activity became more radical as he called on Croats to revolt against Yugoslavia, and schemed an Italian protectorate of Croatia separate from Yugoslavia. After King Alexander I declared his 6 January Dictatorship in 1929 and banned all political parties, Paveli\u0107 went abroad and plotted with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) to undermine the Yugoslav state, which prompted the Yugoslav authorities to try him in absentia and sentence him to death. In the meantime, Paveli\u0107 had moved to Fascist Italy where he founded the Usta\u0161e, a Croatian nationalist movement with the goal of creating an independent Croatia by any means, including the use of terror. Paveli\u0107 incorporated terrorist actions in the Usta\u0161e program, such as train bombings and assassinations, staged a small uprising in Lika in 1932, culminating in the assassination of King Alexander in 1934 in conjunction with the IMRO. Paveli\u0107 was once again sentenced to death after being tried in France in absentia and, under international pressure, the Italians imprisoned him for 18 months, and largely obstructed the Usta\u0161e in the following period.\nAt the behest of the Germans, senior Usta\u0161a Slavko Kvaternik declared the NDH's establishment on 10 April 1941 in the name of Paveli\u0107. Calling himself the Poglavnik, or supreme leader, Paveli\u0107 returned from Italy and took control of the puppet government. He created a political system similar to that of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The NDH, though constituting a Greater Croatia, was forced by the Italians to relinquish several territorial concessions to the latter. After taking control, Paveli\u0107 imposed largely anti-Serbian and antisemitic policies that resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 Serbs and Jews in concentration and extermination camps in the NDH, murdering and torturing several hundred thousand Serbs, along with tens of thousands of Roma and Jews. These persecutions and killings have been described as the \"single most disastrous episode in Yugoslav history\". The racial policies of the NDH greatly contributed to their rapid loss of control over Croatia as they fed the ranks of both the Chetniks and Partisans and caused even the Nazis to attempt to restrain Paveli\u0107 and his genocidal campaign.In 1945, he ordered the executions of prominent NDH politicians Mladen Lorkovi\u0107 and Ante Voki\u0107 on charges of treason when they were arrested for plotting to oust him and align the NDH with the Allies. Following the surrender of Germany in May 1945, Paveli\u0107 ordered his troops to keep fighting even after the surrender. The remainder of the NDH government decided to flee to Austria on 3 May 1945, but Paveli\u0107 instead ordered them to retreat to Austria over the former border of the Third Reich and have the Croatian Armed Forces surrender to the British Army. The British refused to accept the surrender and directed them to surrender to the Partisans. The Partisans began carrying out killings of the Usta\u0161e when the latter attacked their position, killing them in the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators. Paveli\u0107 himself fled to Austria, and later Argentina, whose president Juan Per\u00f3n provided sanctuary for German war criminals and several Usta\u0161e. On 10 April 1957, he was shot several times in an attempted assassination by the Serbian hotel owner Blagoje Jovovi\u0107. Paveli\u0107 initially survived the attempt and soon left Argentina for Spain. He died two and a half years later, on 28 December 1959, aged 70, from the injuries he sustained in the shooting.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "be", "bg", "bs", "ca", "cs", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "gl", "he", "hr", "hu", "hy", "id", "is", "it", "ja", "ko", "lv", "mk", "nl", "nn", "nb", "oc", "pl", "pt", "ro", "ru", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sr", "sv", "th", "tr", "uk", "zh"], "links": ["Ademaga_Me\u0161i\u0107", "Ante_Star\u010devi\u0107", "Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu", "Georges_Valois", "Get\u00falio_Vargas", "Hendrik_Elias", "Hubert_Lagardelle", "Jacques_Benoist-M\u00e9chin", "Jef_Fran\u00e7ois", "Jes\u00fas_Gonz\u00e1lez_Schmal", "Joris_Van_Severen", "Josip_Broz_Tito", "Josip_Frank", "Luc_Michel", "Marcel_D\u00e9at", "Mihajlo_Apostolski", "Mo\u0161a_Pijade", "Mykola_Lebed", "Pl\u00ednio_Salgado", "Tefik_Mborja", "Vladimir_Linderman", "Ward_Hermans"]}, "C\u00e9lestin_Demblon": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/C\u00e9lestin_Demblon", "ID": "502360", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00e9lestin_Demblon", "gender": "M", "name": "[' c\u00e9lestin demblon ', ' demblon celestin ']", "birthDate": "[' 1859-05-19 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1924-12-13 ']", "occupation": "[' writer; politician; teacher ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "C\u00e9lestin Demblon (19 May 1859 \u2013 13 December 1924) was a Belgian socialist politician, teacher and writer, known for his anti-clerical views and his promotion of Francophone Walloon culture.

He became a member of the Nacionalista Party and a close associate of Manuel L. Quezon but this came to an end in 1930 when he joined a wildcat strike by teachers in the capital, causing Quezon to demand his resignation. Ramos did so but became a figure of anti-Quezon agitation, setting up a Tagalog language newspaper Sakdal which gained a wide circulation in rural areas.Ramos reconstituted his followers as the Sakdalista movement. Gaining as many as 20,000 members the group launched an attempted uprising in May 1935 but this was quickly crushed and Ramos went into exile in Japan.Ramos returned to Manila on August 28, 1938 on board the German passenger ship Gneisenau.

He and Emil Preetorius were the Nestors of the German American press in the United States.\nIn the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany, Daenzer had made himself obnoxious to the German government with efforts to bring about German unity by force of arms. For his rebellious course, he was condemned to ten years imprisonment with a heavy fine.

Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during that period, becoming one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety.

He later expressed his remorse for this action.After Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne was part of the Cr\u00eatois, the last group of deputies from The Mountain. He announced on September 28, 1794 that the Committee of Public Safety had nothing to do with the massacres in Vend\u00e9e, and had Louis-Marie Turreau and Jean-Baptiste Carrier arrested for their atrocities, accusing certain deputies of \"laughing at the massacres\".He was arrested by the members of the Thermidorian Reaction which he opposed frontally.

He is best known for his published historical works. Modern historians and researchers cite his comprehensive histories as primary source materials.\nScharf used a formulaic and detailed approach to preparing his historical works. He contacted everyone who could provide information about his subject and used detail questionnaires to capture responses to his inquiries. The J. Thomas Scharf Collection, 1730s\u20131892, held by the Maryland Historical Society, shows off his massive collection of original source materials.Scharf was one of the first American historians to consistently use newspapers as a primary source. Rather than trying to analyze the source material, he often quoted at length from newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and state and city documents. His books are written in the flowery style of his day, and several of his works, although long, are still considered among the best primary sources available. When writing about the American Civil War, the central event of his generation, he could not remain objective, and clearly articulated his strong pro-South perspective and prejudice about the war he fought. Still, his History of the Confederate States Navy remains a particularly valuable contribution to the literature of the American Civil War.At the outbreak of the war, Scharf enlisted with the 1st Maryland Artillery. He fought in the Confederate States Army and Navy. Returning from the war, Scharf helped reorganize the Maryland state militia. He practiced law and took positions as a city editor for the Baltimore Evening News and managing editor for the Baltimore Sunday Telegram. He accumulated a mass of papers on the city of Baltimore and from these he published his first major work, The Chronicles of Baltimore.In 1878, Scharf, a Democrat from Baltimore City-District 2, was elected and served one term in the Maryland General Assembly, House of Delegates. He served as Commissioner of the Land Office of Maryland from 1884 until 1892 and was an active member of the Maryland Historical Society. In the year before he died he was dismissed from his position as \"Special Chinese Inspector\" for the Southern District of New York, a post charged with enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Geary Act of 1892.", "langs": ["ar", "arz"], "links": []}, "John_Andrew_Rea": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Andrew_Rea", "ID": "711565", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Andrew_Rea", "gender": "M", "name": "[' john andrew rea ', ' rea john andrew ']", "birthDate": "[' 1848-06-18 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1941-02-10 ']", "occupation": "[' journalist ', ' politician ', ' journalistandpolitician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "John Andrew Rea (June 18, 1848 \u2013 February 10, 1941) was an American journalist and politician.

Ronning's family moved from China to the Peace River country of Alberta. Halvor Ronning, Chester's father was instrumental in establishing a Norwegian settlement north-west of Grande Prairie called Valhalla Centre. When Chester Ronning started his studies at the University of Alberta, he travelled by horse from Valhalla Centre to Edmonton along the Edson Trail. This was the only \"road\" connecting the Peace country to the provincial capital. In later years the Northern Alberta Railway (now part of Canadian National Railway) was constructed.He returned to China to serve as a missionary from 1922 to 1927 and then returned to Alberta where he took up a position as Principal of the Camrose Lutheran College, a position he held for 15 years. In 1942 he submitted a master's thesis to the University of Alberta's College of Education entitled \"A study of an Alberta Protestant private school: the Camrose Lutheran College, a residential high school.\"He was a member of the United Farmers of Alberta and on October 25, 1932, he was elected in a by-election for Camrose. From his entry into the legislature, he was an outspoken adherent of the newly formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party. He was defeated in the 1935 provincial election that wiped out the UFA government. He was leader of the Alberta CCF from 1940 to 1942. The 1940 Alberta election saw no CCFers elected despite winning 11 per cent of the vote. Ronning stepped aside as leader in favour of Elmer Roper, who won a 1942 by-election to become Alberta's first elected CCF MLA. Ronning ran unsuccessfully for the CCF in the 1945 federal election in the riding of Camrose, losing to the Social Credit candidate, James Alexander Marshall.Ronning served in diplomatic posts in China (1945\u20131951), Norway (1954\u20131957), India (1957\u20131964) and the United Nations.

In 1967 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1972. He was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence in 1983.The legacy of Ronning continues with the Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life at the University of Alberta Augustana Campus in Camrose, Alberta.

Drees left office following the installation of the caretaker Cabinet Beel II on 22 December 1958.\nDrees retired from active politics at 72 but continued to be active as a valued historian and prolific author and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government. Drees was known for his abilities as a skillful team leader and effective manager. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major social reforms to social security, welfare, Child benefits and education, overseeing the decolonization of the Dutch East Indies following the Indonesian National Revolution, the fallout of the annexation of former German territory and dealing with several major crises such as the North Sea flood of 1953 and Hofmans-scandal. Drees was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 22 December 1958 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death in May 1988 at the age of 101. He holds the record as the third longest-serving and longest-lived Prime Minister at 101 years, 314 days and his premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been one of the best in Dutch history.", "langs": ["af", "an", "ar", "arz", "ast", "be", "be-x-old", "br", "ca", "cs", "da", "de", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "fy", "gd", "gl", "he", "hu", "id", "io", "it", "ja", "ko", "kw", "la", "mr", "mzn", "nl", "nb", "oc", "pl", "pt", "ru", "sco", "sh", "simple", "sq", "sv", "sw", "tr", "uk", "vo", "zea", "zh"], "links": ["Andr\u00e9_Rouvoet", "Annemarie_Jorritsma", "Barend_Biesheuvel", "Bert_de_Vries", "Carola_Schouten", "Charles_Welter", "Dirk_Jan_de_Geer", "Dries_van_Agt", "Els_Borst", "Gerard_Helders", "Gerrit_Schimmelpenninck", "Gerrit_Zalm", "Hans_Dijkstal", "Hans_Wiegel", "Hans_Wijers", "Hans_van_Mierlo", "Henk_Hofstra", "Henk_Kamp", "Jacob_Adriaan_de_Wilde", "Jan_Kees_de_Jager", "Jan_de_Quay", "Jelle_Zijlstra", "Jo_Cals", "Johan_Remkes", "Johan_Rudolph_Thorbecke", "Johan_Witteveen", "Joop_den_Uyl", "Joris_in_'t_Veld", "Joseph_Luns", "Kajsa_Ollongren", "Laurens_Jan_Brinkhorst", "Lodewijk_Asscher", "Norbert_Schmelzer", "Piet_Hein_Donner", "Piet_Lieftinck", "Piet_de_Jong", "Pieter_Sjoerds_Gerbrandy", "Roelof_Nelissen", "Ruud_Lubbers", "Sicco_Mansholt", "Theo_de_Meester", "Victor_Marijnen", "Willem_Drees,_Jr.", "Wim_Duisenberg", "Wim_Kok", "Wouter_Bos"]}, "Michel_Pierre_Alexis_H\u00e9bert": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Pierre_Alexis_H\u00e9bert", "ID": "720517", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Pierre_Alexis_H\u00e9bert", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' michel pierre alexis h\u00e9bert ', ' h\u00e9bert michel pierre alexist ']", "birthDate": "[' 1799-07-07 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1887-04-19 ']", "occupation": "[' lawyer politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Michel Pierre Alexis H\u00e9bert (7 July 1799 \u2013 19 April 1887) was a French lawyer, a deputy to the National Assembly from 1834 to 1848 and a Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs during the last year of the July Monarchy.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "fr"], "links": ["Georges_Humann", "Jean_Lacave-Laplagne", "Laurent_Cunin-Gridaine", "Michel_Pierre_Alexis_H\u00e9bert", "Nicolas_Martin_du_Nord", "Pierre_Magne"]}, "Pierre_Magne": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Magne", "ID": "720724", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Magne", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' pierre magne ']", "birthDate": "[' 1806-12-03 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1879-02-17 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Pierre Magne (3 December 1806 \u2013 17 February 1879) was a lawyer and French politician.

His influence on the life of the Danish people and, particularly, the conditions of the peasantry, made him very popular. He was the brother of Johan Ludvig Reventlow which in the late 1700s served as his colleague, of salonist Louise Stolberg, who was his intellectual partner and opponent through their extensive mail correspondence, and of Commodore Conrad Georg Reventlow.\nC. D. F. Reventlow was one of the politicians behind the dissolution of the stavnsb\u00e5nd, which was a serfdom-like institution, bonding men between the ages of 18 and 36 to live on the estate where they were born. This dissolution is widely regarded as having been the work of Reventlow and his two good friends and colleagues Andreas Peter Bernstorff and Christian Colbj\u00f8rnsen.\nFrom 1789, Reventlow was a leading member of the school commission which prepared the Danish School Law of 1814, and he actively contributed to the establishment of teacher seminars. Within the field of forestry, Reventlow was the pioneer behind the \"Fredsskovforordning\" of 1805, which ensured that new trees was strategically planted as logging was carried out. On his own estates, he practiced his political ideas long before they were made laws - moreover, he founded schools, abolished the Danish version of Corv\u00e9e - hoveri - in 1797, he was appointed Minister of the State - statsminister.\nReventlow's criticism of king Frederik's foreign and economic politics, which later led to war with England and state bankruptcy, increased the distance between him and the king. In 1813, he left his political offices - after having been President of the Danish Exchequer for 29 years - as a protest against the Decree of the State Bankruptcy. He was formally a member of the Council of State - the konseil, but he did not participate in the council's meetings.\nReventlow retreated to his Lolland estates, where he, probably being his own architect, erected the main building of Pederstrup and lived a peaceful life, although still actively working with the development of his estates. When the old statesman died in 1827, he was greatly honoured for having fought for civil liberty and the rights of the common people, and for having commenced the agrarian reforms.", "langs": ["arz", "bg", "da", "de", "ja", "nb", "pl", "sv"], "links": []}, "John_Townsend_(mayor)": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Townsend_(mayor)", "ID": "725200", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Townsend_(mayor)", "gender": "M", "name": "[' john townsend ', ' townsend john ']", "birthDate": "[' 1783-06-14 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1854-08-26 ']", "occupation": "[' business magnate ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' whig party (united states) ']", "summary": "John Townsend (1783\u20131854) was a prominent industrialist and politician in the Albany, New York area.

He went to school at Colegio San Jose and then studied law at the University of Cauca, where he graduated on January 27, 1852. He subsequently became a University lecturer in law.\nHis initial military involvement was in 1851, in defence of legal institutions. Two years later his military and political career started in earnest with the Colombian Liberal Party in the fight against the dictator Jose Maria Melo.\nFrom 1860 he took part in revolutionary movements against the Conservative Government of Mariano Ospina Rodriguez. He joined the army of General Thomas Cipriano de Mosquera which was successful in 1861, and he was promoted to the rank of General.\nSubsequently he was part of the Cauca Assembly and served as a government minister on various occasions. He also took part in the Convention of Rionegro which produced the 1863 Constitution.\nIn 1868 he was elected as a Parliamentary representative and then a Senator. In 1878 President Julian Trujillo Largacha appointed him Minister of War and Navy, and a year later he was elected Governor of the Sovereign State of Cauca (1879\u20131883). Hurtado's elevation was due to the \"April Revolution\" (1879), led by Generals Eliseo Payan and Juan de Dios Ulloa, who represented a coalition of independents and \"mosqueristas\" who opposed the abuses committed by radicals.\nLeaving office in 1883, he was elected by Congress to be the Designated President of the Republic and was appointed Presiding Judge by the Supreme Court of Justice. He exercised presidential power between April and August 1884, due to the delay of Rafael Nu\u00f1ez assuming power. In his responsibilities he appointed as cabinet ministers of Housing, Finance, Public Works, External Relations, Public Education and War the following: Manuel M.

In 1894, Romer earned a doctorate in philosophy at University of Lviv. He was a president of Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists (1910\u201311).\nIn final years of the 19th century, he went to Vienna and Berlin to broaden his knowledge of glaciology, geology and meteorology. Romer also went to Lausanne, to study tectonics and morphology. In 1911 he became professor of Lw\u00f3w University (in 1946 also of Jagiellonian University), later he was named professor honoris causa at the universities in Lw\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144 and Krak\u00f3w. In 1952 he became a member of Polish Academy of Sciences\n\nIn 1909 Romer went to Switzerland, to study Alpine glaciers. Next year, he traveled to Asia, and in 1913 to Alaska, to the Saint Elias Mountains (where one of glaciers has been named after him). In 1916, while in Vienna, Romer started work on the Great Statistical and Geographical Atlas of Poland. This atlas, published in Vienna in 1916, was crucial to establishing borders of the Second Polish Republic. He was a member of the Polish delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, helping to draw the western border of Poland.  His Ukrainian rival, and the father of Ukrainian geography, Stepan Rudnytsky, was a fellow student of Albrecht Penck in Vienna. The second edition of his atlas was published in Lw\u00f3w and Warsaw in 1921.\nIn 1921 in Lw\u00f3w Romer founded Cartographical Institute. In 1921-24 he led to a merger of two publishing companies Ksi\u0105\u017cnica and Atlas into Ksiaznica-Atlas, which was moved to Wroc\u0142aw after World War II. It still exists today. In 1929 he retired, concentrating his activities on the institute. However, he kept close ties with Lw\u00f3w's Jan Kazimierz University, lecturing and examining.\nIn 1941, when Lw\u00f3w was captured by the Germans, he hid in a monastery at Piekarska Street, and this decision probably saved his life. Soon after, the Home Army decided to move him to Warsaw, from where he was to be transferred to England to work as an advisor of the Polish government-in-exile. However, doctors recommended that Romer should stay in the occupied country, as the journey was too risky for his weak health. Thus, he remained in Warsaw, using the false name Edmund Piotrowski. Romer survived the Warsaw Uprising and a camp in Pruszk\u00f3w.\nAfter the war, he settled in Krak\u00f3w, taking the post of director of Department of Geography at the Jagiellonian University. Since 1899, he had been married to Jadwiga Rossknecht, daughter of co-owner of the Okocim Brewery. They had two sons: Witold Romer (1900\u20131967), professor of the Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology and Edmund Romer (1904\u20131988), professor of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice.\nEugeniusz Romer died 1954 in Krak\u00f3w and was buried at the Salwator Cemetery.", "langs": ["ar", "be", "de", "eo", "pl", "ru", "uk"], "links": []}, "Ram\u00f3n_Gonz\u00e1lez_Valencia": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ram\u00f3n_Gonz\u00e1lez_Valencia", "ID": "802177", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram\u00f3n_Gonz\u00e1lez_Valencia", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' ram\u00f3n gonz\u00e1lez valencia ', ' gonzalez valencia ramon ']", "birthDate": "[' 1851-05-24 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1928-10-03 ']", "occupation": "[' farmer ', ' soldier ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' colombians ']", "party": "[' colombian conservative party ']", "summary": "Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia (May 24, 1851 \u2013 October 3, 1928) was a Colombian conservative, military officer and statesman.

Santos (born Lope Santos y Canseco, September 25, 1879 \u2013 May 1, 1963) was a Filipino Tagalog-language writer and former senator of the Philippines. He is best known for his 1906 socialist novel, Banaag at Sikat and to his contributions for the development of Filipino grammar and Tagalog orthography.\nLope K. Santos was born in Pasig, Province of Manila (now a part of Metro Manila) as Lope Santos y Canseco to Ladislao Santos, a native of Pasig, and Victorina Canseco, a native of San Mateo, on September 25, 1879. He was raised in Pandacan. His father was imprisoned during Philippine Revolution because Spanish authorities found copies of Jos\u00e9 Rizal's Noli Me Tangere and Ang Kalayaan in his possession.\nSantos was sent to Escuela Normal Superior de Maestros (Higher Normal School for Teachers) for education and later finished schooling at Colegio Filipino. During Philippine Revolution of 1896, Santos joined revolutionaries. By the time of the death of his mother, she requested Lope to marry Simeona Salazar. Marriage happened on February 10, 1900 and they were blessed with three children namely Lakambini, Luwalhati and Makaaraw.\nHe pursued law at the Academia de la Jurisprudencia then at Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation) where he received Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912. In late 1900, Santos started writing his own newspaper Ang Kaliwanagan. This was also the time when socialism becomes an emerging idea in world ideology. When Jos\u00e9 Ma. Dominador Gom\u00e9z was charged and sentenced by the Supreme Court of sedition and illegal association against the government in 1903, Gom\u00e9z's labor group Union Obrera Democratica Filipina (Philippine Democratic Labor Union) was absorbed by Santos. The group was renamed as Union del Trabajo de Filipinas, but was later dissolved in 1907.\nIn 1903, Santos started publishing fragments of his first novel, Banaag at Sikat (From Early Dawn to Full Light) on his weekly labor magazine Muling Pagsilang (The Rebirth) and was completed in 1906. When published in book form, Santos' Banaag at Sikat was then considered the first socialist-oriented book in the Philippines that expounded principles of socialism and sought labor reforms from the government. The book later became an inspiration for the assembly of the 1932 Socialist Party of the Philippines and then the 1946 group Hukbalahap.\nSantos became expert in dupluhan, a form of poetical debate during that time. Dupluhan can be compared to balagtasan, which became popular half a century before Santos' time. He also founded Sampaguita, a weekly lifestyle magazine.\nIn early 1910s, he started a campaign to promote a '\"national language for the Philippines\", where he organized various symposia and lectures and headed numerous departments for national language in leading Philippine universities. In 1910, he was elected governor of the province of Rizal under the Nacionalista Party. In 1918, he was appointed as the first Filipino governor of the newly resurveyed Nueva Vizcaya until 1920. Consequently, he was appointed to the 5th Philippine Legislature as senator from the twelfth senatorial district representing provinces having a majority of non-Christian population. He was the primary author of Philippine Legislature Act No. 2946 which enacted November 30 every year as Bonifacio Day, honoring Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio. He resigned from the Senate in 1921.\nIn 1940, Santos published the first grammar book of the \"national language\", Balarila ng Wikang Pambansa (Grammar of the National Language) which was commissioned by the Surian ng Wikang Pambansa (SWF). The next year, he was appointed by President Manuel L. Quezon as director of SWF until 1946. When the Philippines became a member of the United Nations he was selected to translate the 1935 Constitution for UNESCO. He was also appointed to assist for the translation of inaugural addresses of presidents Jose P. Laurel and Manuel A. Roxas.\nIn early 1960s, he underwent liver operations due to complication.

Roosevelt had been the vice president for only 194 days when he succeeded to the presidency. A Republican, he ran for and won by a landslide a four-year term in 1904. He was succeeded by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and chosen successor, William Howard Taft.\nA Progressive reformer, Roosevelt earned a reputation as a \"trust buster\" through his regulatory reforms and antitrust prosecutions. His presidency saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which established the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food safety, and the Hepburn Act, which increased the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Roosevelt took care, however, to show that he did not disagree with trusts and capitalism in principle, but was only against monopolistic practices. His \"Square Deal\" included regulation of railroad rates and pure foods and drugs; he saw it as a fair deal for both the average citizen and the businessmen. Sympathetic to both business and labor, Roosevelt avoided labor strikes, most notably negotiating a settlement to the great Coal Strike of 1902. He vigorously promoted the conservation movement, emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. He dramatically expanded the system of national parks and national forests. After 1906, he moved to the left, denouncing the rich, attacking trusts, proposing a welfare state, and supporting labor unions.\nIn foreign affairs, Roosevelt sought to uphold the Monroe Doctrine and to establish the United States as a strong naval power, he took charge of building the Panama Canal, which greatly increased access to the Pacific and increased American security interests and trade opportunities. He inherited the colonial empire acquired in the Spanish\u2013American War (1898). He ended the United States Military Government in Cuba and committed to a long-term occupation of the Philippines. Much of his foreign policy focused on the threats posed by Japan in the Pacific and Germany in the Caribbean Sea. Seeking to minimize European power in Latin America, he mediated the Venezuela Crisis and declared the Roosevelt Corollary. Roosevelt mediated the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), for which he won the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. He pursued closer relations with Great Britain.  Biographer William Harbaugh argues:\n\nIn foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. \"If on this new continent,\" he said, \"we merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing.\"Historian Thomas Bailey, who generally disagreed with Roosevelt's policies, nevertheless concluded, \"Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman. He dominated his era as he dominated conversations...the masses loved him; he proved to be a great popular idol and a great vote-getter.\"  His image stands alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln on Mount Rushmore. Although Roosevelt has been criticized by some for his imperialism stance, he is often ranked by historians among the top-five greatest U.S. presidents of all time.", "langs": ["de", "fr", "it", "nl", "pt"], "links": ["Jos\u00e9_Manuel_Marroqu\u00edn"]}, "Ralph_A._Gamble": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ralph_A._Gamble", "ID": "820376", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_A._Gamble", "gender": "M", "name": "[' ralph a gamble ', ' gamble ralph abernethy ']", "birthDate": "[' 1885-05-06 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1959-03-04 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Ralph Abernethy Gamble (May 6, 1885 \u2013 March 4, 1959) was a Republican politician who represented Westchester County, New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1937 to 1957.

After the election of 1925 Welter was appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Cabinet Colijn I, taking office on 1 October 1925. The Cabinet Colijn I fell just 3 months laste on 11 November 1925 and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the cabinet formation of 1926 with Welters not giving a cabinet post in the new cabinet, the Cabinet Colijn I was replaced by the Cabinet De Geer I on 8 March 1926. In March 1926 Welters was nominated as a member of the Council of the Indies, serving from 30 March 1926 until 30 March 1931. Welter semi-retired from active politic and became active in the public sector served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government (Cadastre Agency, Statistics Netherlands and the Welter Commission) and as an diplomat and lobbyist for several economic delegations on behalf of the government. Welter was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1937, taking office on 8 June 1937. Following the cabinet formation of 1937 Welter was appointed again as Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Cabinet Colijn IV, taking office on 24 June 1937. The Cabinet Colijn IV fell on 29 June 1939 and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the first cabinet formation of 1939 with Welters not giving a cabinet post in the new cabinet, the Cabinet Colijn IV was replaced by the Cabinet Colijn V on 25 July 1939. On 25 July 1939 just three days later Cabinet Colijn V was dismissed by Queen Wilhelmina and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the second cabinet formation of 1939 when it was replaced by the Cabinet De Geer II with Welter again appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs, taking office on 10 August 1939.\nOn 10 May 1940 Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands and the government fled to London to escape the German occupation. The Cabinet De Geer II fell on 26 August 1940 after a conflict between Queen Wilhelmina and Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the cabinet formation of 1940 when it was replaced by the Cabinet Gerbrandy I with Welter continuing as Minister of Colonial Affairs and was appointed as Minister of Finance dual serving in both positions, taking office on 3 September 1940. The Cabinet Gerbrandy I fell on 12 June 1941 after a conflict between Queen Wilhelmina and Minister of Defence Adriaan Dijxhoorn and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the cabinet formation of 1941 when it was replaced by the Cabinet Gerbrandy II with Welter continuing as of Minister of Colonial Affairs, taking office on 27 July 1941. On 17 November 1941 Welter and Minister of Finance and Minister of Commerce, Industry and Shipping Max Steenberghe resigned after disagreeing with the cabinets war policies.\nReturning to the Netherlands in 1945, Welter was appointed member of the Senate for the Catholic People's Party. In March 1946 he was a member of the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the policy of the Dutch East Indies government. He disagreed strongly with the government policy on the Dutch Indies; as well as his party's cooperation with the Labor Party. \nFrom the beginning of 1947, the Provisional Catholic Committee of Action acted within the KVP against the Indonesian policy of the 'Roman-Red coalition'. In 1948, this committee took part in the parliamentary elections with a separate Welter list, winning a single seat.  On 11 December 1948 the Catholic National Party was established. Welter, who occupied the only seat in parliament, also became the first general chairman of the KNP.After the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia, this KNP initially seemed to still have a reason to exist, especially as a right-wing opposition party, not only with regard to the lasting problems in relations with Indonesia, which had become independent, but also in opposition to the trade union influence within the Catholic People's Party. In 1952, the KNP achieved 2.7% of the vote and 2 seats. In October 29 1955 under pressure from the bishops the KNP merged back into the Catholic People's Party. When the Drees cabinet fell at the end of 1958, Welter's last complaint against the KVP also disappeared, because years of cooperation with the socialists came to an end. \nWelter remained as a Member of Parliament for the KVP from 1956 to 1963.", "langs": ["nl"], "links": ["Dirk_Jan_de_Geer", "Gerard_Helders", "Gerrit_Jan_van_Heuven_Goedhart", "Gerrit_Schimmelpenninck", "Gerrit_Zalm", "Hans_Wijers", "Henk_Hofstra", "Jacob_Adriaan_de_Wilde", "Jan_Kees_de_Jager", "Jelle_Zijlstra", "Johan_Witteveen", "Piet_Lieftinck", "Pieter_Sjoerds_Gerbrandy", "Roelof_Nelissen", "Theo_de_Meester", "Willem_Drees", "Wim_Duisenberg", "Wim_Kok", "Wouter_Bos"]}, "William_Litterer": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Litterer", "ID": "859896", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Litterer", "gender": "M", "name": "[' william litterer ', ' litterer william ']", "birthDate": "[' 1834-08-24 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' pilot ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' united states ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "William Litterer (1834\u20131917) was an American Democratic politician.

He moved to Texas in 1892 and settled in the Corpus Christi area as a truck farmer. From 1899 to 1914 he was a member of the Texas legislature, where he served in the House of the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh legislatures and in the Senate of the Twenty-eighth through the Thirty-third. He was chairman of committees on finance and internal improvements and served on committees on judicial districts and stock raising. Willacy was perhaps best known as the author of the bill providing for county local option, which is the ability of local political jurisdictions, typically counties or municipalities, to allow decisions on certain controversial issues based on popular vote within their borders. In practice, it usually relates to the issue of alcoholic beverage sales, which in the 1920s and 30s was a controversial issue, especially as prohibition in the United States was in effect. In 1911 Willacy introduced a bill to form a new county out of parts of Cameron and Hidalgo counties, and the resulting new county was named in his honor. He moved from Corpus Christi to San Antonio in 1912, and in the early 1920s was state tax commissioner under Governor Pat Morris Neff.

She was one of four female candidates at the 1903 federal election, the first at which women were eligible to stand.\nGoldstein was born in Portland, Victoria. Her family moved to Melbourne in 1877 when she was around eight years old, where she would attend Presbyterian Ladies' College. Goldstein followed her mother into the women's suffrage movement and soon became one of its leaders, becoming known both for her public speaking and as an editor of pro-suffrage publications. Despite her efforts, Victoria was the last Australian state to implement equal voting rights, with women not granted the right to vote until 1908.\nIn 1903, Goldstein unsuccessfully contested the Senate as an independent, winning 16.8 percent of the vote. She was one of the first four women to stand for federal parliament, along with Selina Anderson, Nellie Martel, and Mary Moore-Bentley. Goldstein ran for parliament a further four times, and despite never winning an election won back her deposit on all but one occasion. She stood on left-wing platforms, and some of her more radical views alienated both the general public and some of her associates in the women's movement.\nAfter women's suffrage was achieved, Goldstein remained prominent as a campaigner for women's rights and various other social reforms. She was an ardent pacifist during World War I, and helped found the Women's Peace Army, an anti-war organisation. Goldstein maintained a lower profile in later life, devoting most of her time to the Christian Science movement. Her death passed largely unnoticed, and it was not until the late 20th century that her contributions were brought to the attention of the general public.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "ca", "cy", "de", "es", "eu", "fr", "hu", "hy", "ml", "pl", "ps", "pt", "ru", "sv"], "links": []}, "Jonathan_Sturges": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Sturges", "ID": "883610", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sturges", "gender": "M", "name": "[' jonathan sturges ']", "birthDate": "[' 1740-08-23 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1819-10-04 ']", "occupation": "[' lawyer ', ' jurist ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Jonathan Sturges (August 23, 1740 \u2013 October 4, 1819) was an American lawyer, jurist and politician from Fairfield, Connecticut.

He was a civil engineer employed by the national railways of Austria-Hungary. In 1909, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP) and became an ardent party agitator. Because of his political activism, Jung was fired, but the party put him on its payroll and he devoted himself to theoretical work.Along with Dr. Walter Riehl, Jung drafted the Jihlava party program of 1913 \"which contained a more detailed comparison of international Marxism and national socialism and a more pointed attack on Capitalism, Democracy, alien peoples, and Jews. Here, anti-semitism ranked behind anti-Slavism, anti-clericalism and anti-capitalism.\"  In 1919, Jung completed his theoretical work Der Nationale Sozialismus.  In his introduction, he expressed the hope that his book would play the same role for National Socialism that Das Kapital had for Marxian socialism.At the end of World War I, the DAP was renamed the Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei (DNSAP). Jung convinced Hitler to include the term \"National Socialist\" in the name of the German Workers' Party, the DAP's counterpart in Germany. Hitler originally wanted to rename the German DAP the \"Social Revolutionary Party\".Some of the posts Jung held were: President of the State Labour office in Middle Germany, Gauleiter ad Honorem (honorary), and in 1936, Member of the Reichstag for the district of Westphalia South. In 1943, Jung became the Reich Inspector and Director of the Reich Inspection of Labour Administration.He wrote several books, including Der nationale Sozialismus: seine Grundlagen, sein Werdegang und seine Ziele (National Socialism, its Foundations, Development and Goals), Aussig, 1919.  2nd ed.; Munich: Deutscher Volksverlag Dr. Boepple, 1922.After the war he was detained by Czechoslovak authorities and imprisoned.

Rogers was later appointed Judge Advocate General of the Philadelphia National Guard, with the rank of colonel.A prominent attorney and politician in Philadelphia, Rogers came to the baseball business when former player and sporting goods magnate Al Reach consulted with him on a patent for a baseball.  Rogers and Reach later teamed up to acquire the remnants of the Worcester Worcesters in 1883, winning the rights to the franchise via drawing of lots. Reach and Rogers relocated the franchise to Philadelphia, where they became known as the Quakers (they would later become the Phillies), entering the team as an expansion franchise in the National League in 1883. During these early days, Rogers was involved in creating baseball's reserve clause, which would remain in effect until the era of free agency.\nReach and Rogers sold the Phillies to a group led by James Potter in February 1903, but retained the rights to the team's stadium, National League Park (which eventually became Baker Bowl). On August 8, a balcony collapsed at the park, killing 12 people and injuring hundreds more.  Rogers was nearly ruined by the resulting avalanche of lawsuits, and was forced to sell the stadium to Potter as well.

He was twice nominated as the presidential candidate of the Federalist Party, in 1804 and 1808, but lost both elections, the first to Thomas Jefferson and the second to James Madison.\nPinckney was born into a powerful planter family from South Carolina. He practiced law for several years and was elected to the colonial legislature. A supporter of independence from Great Britain, Pinckney served in the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of brigadier-general. After the war, he won election to the South Carolina legislature, where he and his brother Thomas represented the landed slaveholding elite of the South Carolina Lowcountry. An advocate of a stronger federal government, Pinckney served as a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which wrote a new federal constitution. Pinckney's influence helped ensure that South Carolina would ratify the United States Constitution.\nPinckney declined George Washington's first offer to serve in his administration, but in 1796 Pinckney accepted the position of minister to France. In what became known as the XYZ Affair, the French demanded a bribe before they would agree to meet with the U.S. delegation. Pinckney returned to the United States, accepting an appointment as a general during the Quasi-War with France. Though he had resisted joining either major party for much of the 1790s, Pinckney began to identify with the Federalist Party following his return from France. The Federalists chose him as their vice presidential nominee in the 1800 presidential election, hoping that his presence on the ticket could win support for the party in the American South. Though Alexander Hamilton schemed to elect Pinckney president under the electoral rules then in place, both Pinckney and incumbent Federalist President John Adams were defeated by the Democratic-Republican candidates.\nSeeing little hope of defeating popular incumbent president Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists chose Pinckney as their presidential nominee for the 1804 election. Neither Pinckney nor the party pursued an active campaign, and Jefferson won in a landslide. The Federalists nominated Pinckney again in 1808, in the hope that Pinckney's military experience and Jefferson's economic policies would give the party a chance of winning.

He served as the first and founding head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, his development of the ideology is known as Leninism.\nBorn to an upper-middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Following Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\nLenin's Bolshevik government initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty conceding territory to the Central Powers, and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Republic after 1917, but five were forcibly re-united into the new Soviet Union in 1922, while others repelled Soviet invasions. His health failing, Lenin died in Gorki, with Joseph Stalin succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism\u2013Leninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by his supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class. Meanwhile, Lenin's critics accuse him of establishing a totalitarian dictatorship which oversaw mass killings and political repression.", "langs": ["af", "als", "am", "an", "ang", "anp", "ar", "ary", "arz", "as", "ast", "av", "avk", "awa", "ay", "az", "azb", "ba", "ban", "bar", "bat-smg", "bcl", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bh", "bi", "bn", "bo", "bpy", "br", "bs", "bxr", "ca", "cbk-zam", "cdo", "ce", "ceb", "ch", "ckb", "co", "crh", "cs", "cv", "cy", "da", "de", "diq", "dsb", "dty", "el", "eml", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "ext", "fa", "fi", "fiu-vro", "fo", "fr", "frp", "frr", "fy", "ga", "gan", "gd", "gl", "gn", "gom", "got", "gu", "ha", "hak", "he", "hi", "hif", "hr", "hsb", "ht", "hu", "hy", "hyw", "ia", "id", "ie", "ilo", "io", "is", "it", "iu", "ja", "jam", "jbo", "jv", "ka", "kaa", "kbp", "kk", "km", "kn", "ko", "ks", "ku", "kw", "ky", "la", "lad", "lb", "lez", "lfn", "li", "lij", "lmo", "lo", "lt", "lv", "mai", "mg", "mhr", "mk", "ml", "mn", "mr", "ms", "mt", "mwl", "my", "mzn", "nds", "ne", "new", "nl", "nn", "nb", "nrm", "oc", "os", "pa", "pap", "pih", "pl", "pms", "pnb", "pnt", "ps", "pt", "qu", "rm", "ro", "ru", "rue", "sa", "sah", "sat", "scn", "sco", "sh", "si", "simple", "sk", "sl", "so", "sq", "sr", "st", "sv", "sw", "szl", "ta", "te", "tg", "th", "tl", "tr", "tt", "tyv", "udm", "uk", "ur", "uz", "vec", "vep", "vi", "war", "wuu", "xmf", "yi", "yo", "za", "zh", "zh-classical", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue", "zu"], "links": ["Alexander_Guchkov", "Anastas_Mikoyan", "Angelica_Balabanoff", "Cesare_Beccaria", "Cicero", "Clara_Zetkin", "Dante_Alighieri", "Early_life_of_Vladimir_Lenin", "Eduard_Bernstein", "Francesco_Guicciardini", "Josip_Broz_Tito", "Manuel_Azc\u00e1rate", "Revolutionary_activity_of_Vladimir_Lenin"]}, "Bernhardt_Holtermann": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernhardt_Holtermann", "ID": "951480", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhardt_Holtermann", "gender": "M", "name": "[' bernhardt otto holtermann ', ' holtermann bernhardt otto ']", "birthDate": "[' 1838-04-29 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1885-04-29 ']", "occupation": "[' gold miner businessman and politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Bernhardt Otto Holtermann (29 April 1838 \u2013 29 April 1885) was a successful gold miner, businessman, politician and photographer in Australia.

He played an important role in the consolidation of Albanian as the national language of Albania with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces. He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications on Skanderbeg, Shakespeare, Beethoven, religious texts and translations. He produced a translation of the New Testament in English, The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece, published in 1961.\nNoli earned degrees at Harvard (1912), the New England Conservatory of Music (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from Boston University (1945). He was ordained a priest in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of US President Woodrow Wilson. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the League of Nations.\nA respected figure who remained critical of corruption and injustice in the Albanian government, Fan Noli was asked to lead the 1924 June Revolution.

Generally seen as the main variety of local fascism, and noted for its mystical and Romanian Orthodox-inspired revolutionary message, it gained prominence on the Romanian political stage, coming into conflict with the political establishment and the democratic forces, and often resorting to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as C\u0103pitanul (\"The Captain\"), and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death.\nCodreanu, who began his career in the wake of World War I as an anticommunist and antisemitic agitator associated with A. C. Cuza and Constantin Pancu, was a co-founder of the National-Christian Defense League and assassin of the Ia\u0219i Police prefect Constantin Manciu. Codreanu left Cuza to found a succession of movements on the far right, rallying around him a growing segment of the country's intelligentsia and peasant population, and inciting pogroms in various parts of Greater Romania. Several times outlawed by successive Romanian cabinets, his Legion assumed different names and survived in the underground, during which time Codreanu formally delegated leadership to Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Gr\u0103nicerul. Following Codreanu's instructions, the Legion carried out assassinations of politicians it viewed as corrupt, including Premier Ion G. Duca and his former associate Mihai Stelescu. Simultaneously, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu advocated Romania's adherence to a military and political alliance with Nazi Germany.\nDuring the 1937 suffrage, his party registered its strongest showing, placing third and winning 15.8% of the vote. It was blocked out of power by King Carol II, who invited the rival fascists and fourth-place finishers of the National Christian Party to form a short-lived government, succeeded by the National Renaissance Front royal dictatorship. The rivalry between Codreanu and, on the other side, Carol and moderate politicians like Nicolae Iorga ended with Codreanu's imprisonment at Jilava and eventual assassination at the hands of the Gendarmerie. He was succeeded as leader by Horia Sima. In 1940, under the National Legionary State proclaimed by the Iron Guard, his killing served as the basis for violent retribution.\nCorneliu Zelea Codreanu's views influenced the modern far-right. Groups claiming him as a forerunner include Noua Dreapt\u0103 and other Romanian successors of the Iron Guard, the International Third Position, and various neofascist organizations in Italy and other parts of Europe.", "langs": ["ast", "bg", "ca", "cs", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "fa", "fi", "fr", "gl", "he", "hu", "it", "ja", "ko", "la", "nl", "nn", "nb", "pl", "pt", "ro", "ru", "sr", "sv", "uk", "zh"], "links": ["Ante_Paveli\u0107", "Dieudonn\u00e9_M'bala_M'bala", "Georges_Valois", "Get\u00falio_Vargas", "Hendrik_Elias", "Hubert_Lagardelle", "Jacques_Benoist-M\u00e9chin", "Jef_Fran\u00e7ois", "Jes\u00fas_Gonz\u00e1lez_Schmal", "Joris_Van_Severen", "Luc_Michel", "Marcel_D\u00e9at", "Pl\u00ednio_Salgado", "Tefik_Mborja", "Vladimir_Linderman", "Ward_Hermans"]}, "John_Malcolm": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Malcolm", "ID": "986810", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malcolm", "gender": "M", "name": "[' sir john malcolm ']", "birthDate": "[' 1769-05-02 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1833-05-30 ']", "occupation": "[' soldier ', ' politician ', ' historian ']", "nationality": "[' british people ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Major-General Sir John Malcolm GCB, KLS (2 May 1769 \u2013 30 May 1833) was a Scottish soldier, diplomat, East India Company administrator, statesman, and historian.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "az", "de", "fa", "fr", "ru", "sv", "ta"], "links": []}, "Song_Byung-jun": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song_Byung-jun", "ID": "987268", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Byung-jun", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' byung-jun song ']", "birthDate": "[' 1857-08-20 ']", "deathDate": "[' 2020-08-25 ']", "occupation": "[' korean politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Song Byeong-jun (Korean:\uc1a1\ubcd1\uc900, hanja:\u5b8b\u79c9\u756f, August 20, 1857 \u2013 February 1, 1925) was a Korean Joseon dynasty politician, noted for his role in the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910.

A journalist and politician during the French Revolution, he was a vigorous defender of the sans-culottes, a radical voice, and published his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers. His periodical L'Ami du peuple (Friend of the People) made him an unofficial link with the radical Jacobin group that came to power after June 1793.\nHis journalism was known for its fierce tone and uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution. Responsibility for the September massacres has been attributed to him, given his position of renown at the time, and an alleged paper trail of decisions leading up to the massacres. Others posit the collective mentality that made them possible resulted from circumstances and not from the will of any particular individual. Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. Corday was executed four days later for his assassination, on 17 July 1793.\nIn death, Marat became an icon to the Montagnards faction of the Jacobins as well as the greater sans-culotte population, and a revolutionary martyr; according to contemporary accounts, some even mourned him with a kind of prayer: \"O heart of Jesus! O sacred heart of Marat\". The most famous painter in Paris, Jacques-Louis David, immortalized Marat in his iconic painting The Death of Marat.

Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and Roman constitutionalist, reached the height of Roman power, the Consulship, and played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. A contemporary of Julius Caesar, Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.Cicero is generally perceived to be one of the most versatile minds of ancient Rome. He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary, distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher.  An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters to Atticus contained such a wealth of detail \"concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government\" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.During the chaotic middle period of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. \"Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!\" wrote C.

Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported Chinese nationalism and had an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at Peking University as a librarian and became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land reform policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after Japan's surrender, and Mao's forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a Marxist\u2013Leninist single-party state controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the Chinese Land Reform against landlords, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the \"Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\", and through a truce in the Korean War, which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing command economy in China, constructing the first Constitution of the PRC, launching the industrialisation program, and initiating military projects such as the \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" project and Project 523. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the Sino-Soviet split which drove a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. In 1955, Mao launched the Sufan movement, and in 1957 he launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted. In 1958, he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from agrarian to industrial, which led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 15\u201355 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement, and in 1966 he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its family planning policy.\nWidely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, Mao remains a controversial figure within and outside China. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. Mao has been praised for transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power, with greatly advanced literacy, women's rights, basic healthcare, primary education and life expectancy. The government during Mao's rule was also responsible for vast numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions. During his leadership tenure, China was heavily involved with other Asian communist conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War, which brought the Khmer Rouge to power.", "langs": ["af", "als", "am", "an", "anp", "ar", "ary", "arz", "as", "ast", "awa", "ay", "az", "azb", "ba", "bar", "bat-smg", "bcl", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bh", "bi", "bn", "bo", "br", "bs", "bxr", "ca", "cdo", "ce", "ceb", "ckb", "crh", "cs", "cv", "cy", "da", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "ext", "fa", "fi", "fiu-vro", "fo", "fr", "fy", "ga", "gan", "gcr", "gd", "gl", "gn", "gom", "ha", "hak", "he", "hi", "hif", "hr", "hu", "hy", "ia", "id", "ilo", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "jam", "jbo", "jv", "ka", "kbp", "kk", "km", "kn", "ko", "ksh", "ku", "kw", "ky", "la", "lad", "lb", "lez", "lmo", "lt", "lv", "mai", "mg", "mk", "ml", "mn", "mr", "ms", "mt", "my", "mzn", "nds", "ne", "nl", "nn", "nb", "ny", "oc", "olo", "os", "pa", "pl", "pms", "pnb", "ps", "pt", "qu", "ro", "ru", "rue", "sa", "sah", "sat", "scn", "sco", "sd", "se", "sh", "shn", "si", "simple", "sk", "sl", "so", "sq", "sr", "sv", "sw", "ta", "te", "tg", "th", "tl", "tr", "tt", "ug", "uk", "ur", "uz", "vec", "vep", "vi", "vo", "wa", "war", "wuu", "xal", "xmf", "yi", "yo", "za", "zh", "zh-classical", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue"], "links": ["Cai_Yuanpei", "Cesare_Beccaria", "Cicero", "Clara_Zetkin", "Dante_Alighieri", "Early_life_of_Mao_Zedong", "Eduard_Bernstein", "Francesco_Guicciardini", "Josip_Broz_Tito", "Vladimir_Lenin"]}, "Zygmunt_Balicki": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zygmunt_Balicki", "ID": "995159", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Balicki", "gender": "M", "name": "[' zygmunt balicki ', ' balicki zygmunt ']", "birthDate": "[' 1858-12-30 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1916-09-12 ']", "occupation": "[' sociology ', ' sociologist politician writer ']", "nationality": "[' poles ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Zygmunt Balicki (30 December 1858 in Lublin \u2013 12 September 1916 in Saint Petersburg) was a Polish sociologist, publicist and one of the first leading thinkers of the modern Polish nationalism in the late 19th century under the foreign Partitions of Poland.

Having founded, with his friend Pierre de Decker, the Revue de Bruxelles, he advocated in that paper a system of parliamentary government which was termed \"government of the centres\". The ministries were to be composed of Catholics and Liberals and to be supported by the moderate elements of the two parties. The scheme worked for some years. In 1834 Dechamps was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, where his talent as an orator soon secured him a prominent position. In 1836 he participated very actively in the discussion of the bill on the organization of the communes, and in 1839 he opposed the Treaty of London, 1839. The Great Powers had imposed that treaty on Belgium and the Netherlands in 1834, but the latter had delayed accepting it in the hope that she might eventually obtain better conditions. Deschamps, with many others, held that by this delay the Netherlands had forfeited her right to the advantages granted her by the Powers and they urged the Government to appeal to arms rather than to surrender any part of Belgian territory. This warlike policy, however, would have been opposed by the Great Powers, and peace was finally signed with the Netherlands.\nHe also played a leading part in the passing of the bill on elementary education. Up to 1842 there had been no elementary public schools in Belgium, although there were numerous schools organized under the direction of the clergy. One of the provisions of the new bill enacted that religious instruction was to form an essential part of public education and to be under the control of the clergy. The bill was passed almost unanimously by the votes of both Catholics and Liberals. From 1843 to 1848 Dechamps was a member of several ministries. After the defeat of his party in 1848 he became the leader of the Catholic minority in the Chamber of Representatives and retained that position for several years.

His tenure as leader of the Baku Commune was marred with numerous problems including ethnic violence between Baku's Armenian and Azerbaijani populations, attempting to defend the city against an advancing Turkish army, all the while attempting to spread the cause of the revolution throughout the region. Unlike many of the other Bolsheviks at the time however, he preferred to resolve many of the conflicts he faced peacefully, rather than with force and terror.Shaumian was known by various aliases, including \"Suren\", \"Surenin\" and \u201cAyaks\". As the Baku Commune was voted out of power in July 1918, he and his followers, known as the 26 Baku Commissars abandoned the city, fleeing across the Caspian Sea.

In 1861, at the start of the Civil War, Steuart left his home state of Maryland and joined the Confederacy, though at 71 years of age he was by then considered too old for active service. This did not prevent him from personally riding with Lee's army and even being captured at the First Battle of Manassas.\nHe is sometimes confused with his eldest son, Brigadier General George H.

In the 1880s he became the Minister of the Navy and later the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Portugal. The zoology collection at the Lisbon Museum is called the Bocage Museum in his honor.\nDu Bocage was born in Funchal, Madeira.  He studied at the University of Coimbra from 1839 to 1846. He became lecturer of the chair of Zoology at the Polytechnic School, Lisbon (later the Science Faculty of the University of Lisbon) in 1851, where he taught for more than 30 years. In 1858, he became also the scientific director and curator of Zoology of the Natural History Museum of the Polytechnic School. which was established as a support for the chair.\nHis work at the Museum consisted in acquiring, describing and coordinating collections, many of which arrived from the Portuguese colonies in Africa, such as Angola, Mozambique, etc., sent by noted naturalists such as Jos\u00e9 Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta (1832\u20131897). For this purpose, du Bocage standardized the procedures for collecting, preparing and sending specimens to the Museum in his book \u201cInstruc\u00e7\u00f5es Pr\u00e1cticas sobre o Modo de Colligir, Preparar e Remetter Productos Zool\u00f3gicos para o Museu de Lisboa\u201d (1862). In 1860 he succeeded in getting back some collections which were removed from the Museum during the Napoleonic invasion of Portugal, by the French naturalist \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772\u20131844), which included precious specimens collected by Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (1756\u20131815) in Brazil.\nIn 1875, he was elected Vice-President of the Academia Real das Ci\u00eancias de Lisboa. He retired from educational activities in 1880 but remained director of the Museum until he devoted his remaining life to politics, first as the Minister of Navy and Ultramarine Possessions and later as Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 1883 to 1886, and again in 1890. His political activities as Minister include the management of several diplomatic treatises with European powers on the subject of Portugal's possessions in Africa. Most notably are his involvement with the Berlin Conference, and also in the negotiations following the 1890 British Ultimatum forced upon Portugal.\nDu Bocage published more than 200 taxonomic papers about mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and many others. He was responsible for identifying many new species, several of which he named according to the naturalist who found them (for example, dozens of new species received the specific name, anchietae, honoring Portuguese naturalist Jos\u00e9 Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta).\nDu Bocage is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards: Podarcis bocagei and Trachylepis bocagii.Jos\u00e9 Vicente was a second cousin of the famous poet Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage (1765\u20131805). \nOn April 10, 1905, a governmental decree renamed the zoological section of the National Museum of Lisbon as the \"Museu Jos\u00e9 Vicente Barboza du Bocage\".\nDu Bocage died in Lisbon, Portugal, aged 83.", "langs": ["br", "de", "eo", "es", "fi", "fr", "gl", "it", "nl", "pt", "ru", "uk"], "links": []}, "Tom\u00e1\u0161_Eduard_\u0160ilinger": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Eduard_\u0160ilinger", "ID": "1094216", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Eduard_\u0160ilinger", "gender": "M", "name": "[' tom\u00e1\u0161 eduard \u0161ilinger ', ' silinger tomas eduard ']", "birthDate": "[' 1866-12-16 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1917-06-17 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ', ' journalist ', ' politician and journalist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Eduard \u0160ilinger (16 December 1866, Tu\u010d\u00edn \u2013 17 June 1913, Luha\u010dovice) was a Czech politician and journalist.

He is the most prominent example of the continuity of the administrative elites between Nazi Germany and the early West Germany. \nIn 1936, Globke wrote a legal annotation on the antisemitic Nuremberg Race Laws that did not express any objection to the discrimination against Jews, placing the Nazi Party on a firmer legal ground and setting the path to the Holocaust during World War II. By 1938, Globke had been promoted to Ministerialdirigent in the Office for Jewish Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior, where he produced the Name Change Ordinance, a law that forced Jewish men to take the middle name Israel and Jewish women Sara for easier identification. In 1941, during the Nazi period, he issued another statute that stripped Jews in occupied territories of their statehood and possessions.

He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the Communist Party while that power oscillated between the Central Committee and the Politburo. His career extended from the days of Lenin, to the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, to his peaceful retirement under Brezhnev.\nAn early convert to the Bolshevik cause, Mikoyan participated in the Baku Commune under the leadership of Stepan Shahumyan during the Russian Civil War in the Caucasus. In the 1920s, he served as the First Secretary of the North Caucasus region. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. However, by the 1940s, Mikoyan began to lose favour with Stalin. In 1949, he lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade, and in October 1952, Stalin attacked him harshly at the 19th Party Congress. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. Together, he and Khrushchev crafted the de-Stalinization policy and later he became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position during the Thaw made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.\nMikoyan made several key trips to communist Cuba and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.", "langs": ["af", "ar", "arz", "ast", "az", "ba", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "ca", "cs", "da", "de", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "he", "hu", "hy", "hyw", "id", "io", "it", "ja", "ka", "kk", "ko", "ky", "lt", "lv", "nl", "nb", "pl", "ps", "pt", "ru", "sco", "simple", "sl", "sr", "sv", "tr", "tt", "uk", "vi", "zh", "zh-classical"], "links": ["Rudolf_Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd", "Stepan_Shaumian", "Vladimir_Lenin"]}, "Gustave_Bo\u00ebl": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustave_Bo\u00ebl", "ID": "1118427", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Bo\u00ebl", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' gustave bo\u00ebl ', ' boel gustave ']", "birthDate": "[' 1837-05-18 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1912-03-31 ']", "occupation": "[' industrialist politician ']", "nationality": "[' belgium ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Gustave Andr\u00e9 Bo\u00ebl (18 May 1837 \u2013 31 March 1912) was a Belgian industrialist and liberal politician.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958.\nBrown was educated in Winnipeg. He enlisted in the Cycle Corps at the beginning of World War I, and served overseas in France, seeing action at Ypres, Vimy Ridge, and Passchendaele. Brown joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1917, and remained with this group until the end of the war.\nFrancis Roy Brown was throughout his life mistaken for the pilot that shot down Baron Von Richthofen, a.k.a.\"The Red Baron\". That credit remains with A. Roy Brown, of Carleton Place, Ontario. Both Roy Browns were enlisted with the Royal Flying Corps at the same time. They both returned to Canada with English 'war brides', and both established their careers in the early aviation industry flourish of the 1920s, '30s, and '40s. For the remainder of their lives, F. Roy Brown would be known as \"Arctic Roy\", while A. Roy Brown was known as \"Richthofen Roy\". They met for the first time at a POW reunion in 1937.\nBrown was intrinsic to the discovery of a group of seven men who were lost in the Arctic in late 1929. It was the greatest air search and rescue in Canadian history and remains as such, given they had no radar or radios. Col. C.D.W. MacAlpine and his exploration party of cartographers, geographers from McGill University set off to the chart the North, and after the undercarriage collapsed in their aircraft, they were lost in the far northern reaches of the Arctic, near Baker Lake see The Montreal Gazette November\u2013December articles entitled \"Lost in the Barrens!\".\nAfter the war, he was one of four who founded Western Canada Airways in Manitoba, and was superintendent and chief pilot of the company's airmail operations from 1930 to 1932.\nHe was Manager of the Lac du Bonnet government airbase during the early 1930s. He helped establish Wings Limited, and Central Northern Airways, a predecessor of TransAir Limited, in 1947, and served as its vice-president. He was also a member of the Winnipeg Flying Club, and an executive on the Wartime Pilots' & Observers Association. During World War II he was a test pilot for McDonald Brothers now Bristol Aerospace. Brown had a legacy association with A.V.Roe, having flown numerous single engine planes designed by Roe during his extensive years of bush flying.\nBrown's piloting skills were undoubtedly useful to his political career, as he represented the northern constituency of Rupertsland in the Manitoba assembly. During the 1950s, many of Rupertsland's communities were remote and isolated, and could only be reached by plane. Brown himself was credited with bringing considerable development into the region.\nHe was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1953 provincial election, defeating fellow Liberal-Progressive H. Boulette, 1,136 votes to 982. In this period of Manitoba history, voting in Rupertsland was deferred for logistical reasons until after the rest of the province had voted. The Liberal-Progressives had already won a majority government, and no opposition parties contested the constituency.\nBrown was resoundingly defeated when he ran for re-election in the 1958 campaign. The Progressive Conservatives under Dufferin Roblin had already won a minority government in the rest of the province, and there was little incentive for voters in this remote area to elect an opposition member. Brown lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Joseph Jeannotte, 2,342 votes to 511.\nHe was posthumously inducted to Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame in 1975.", "langs": ["ar", "arz"], "links": []}, "Ernst_Heinrich_von_Schimmelmann": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernst_Heinrich_von_Schimmelmann", "ID": "1124952", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Heinrich_von_Schimmelmann", "gender": "M", "name": "[' ernst heinrich von schimmelmann ']", "birthDate": "[' 1747-12-04 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1831-02-09 ']", "occupation": "[' businessman politician estate owner ']", "nationality": "[' denmark ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann (4 December 1747 \u2013 9 February 1831) was a German-born Danish politician, businessman, nobleman, planter and philanthropist.", "langs": ["da", "de", "nb", "ru", "sv", "uk"], "links": ["Christian_Ditlev_Frederik_Reventlow", "Heinrich_Carl_von_Schimmelmann"]}, "Jules_Boedt": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Boedt", "ID": "1125003", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Boedt", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' jules boedt ', ' boedt jules ']", "birthDate": "[' 1884-07-03 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1966-10-02 ']", "occupation": "[' politician lawyer ']", "nationality": "[' belgium ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Jules Charles Stanislas Boedt (3 July 1884 \u2013 2 October 1966) was a Flemish-Belgian lawyer and liberal politician.\nHe was a municipal council member in Bruges, a member of the Belgian parliament, and president of the Liberaal Vlaams Verbond (1928\u20131934).", "langs": ["arz", "nl"], "links": []}, "Frank_A._Montgomery": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_A._Montgomery", "ID": "1125757", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Montgomery", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' frank alexander montgomery ', ' montgomery frank alexander ']", "birthDate": "[' 1830-01-07 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1903-12-16 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Frank Alexander Montgomery (January 7, 1830 \u2013 December 16, 1903) was an American politician best known for his memoir of life as a Confederate cavalry officer in the Western Theater of the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) called Reminiscences of a Mississippian in Peace and War (1901).", "langs": ["ar", "azb"], "links": []}, "Thomas_Vincent_Welch": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Vincent_Welch", "ID": "1126270", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vincent_Welch", "gender": "M", "name": "[' thomas vincent welch ']", "birthDate": "[' 1850-10-01 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1903-10-20 ']", "occupation": "[' politician ', ' conservation movement ', ' civil service ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "[' history of the united states democratic party ']", "summary": "Thomas Vincent Welch (October 1, 1850 \u2013 October 20, 1903) was a New York State Assemblyman and served as the first Superintendent of the New York State Reservation at Niagara, holding the post for 18 years.

Cicero was a Roman politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, philosopher, and constitutionalist who lived during the years of 106\u201343 BC. He held the positions of Roman senator and Roman consul (chief-magistrate) and played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. He was extant during the rule of prominent Roman politicians, such as those of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Marc Antony. Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.Cicero is generally held to be one of the most versatile minds of ancient Rome. He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy, and also created a Latin philosophical vocabulary; distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher.  A distinguished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero likely valued his political career as his most important achievement. Today he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters to Atticus contained such a wealth of detail \"concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government\" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.During the chaotic latter half of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. \"Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!\" wrote C. Asinius Pollio, a contemporary Roman statesman and historian.A manuscript containing Cicero's letters to Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus was rediscovered by Petrarch in 1345 at the Capitolare library in Verona. This rediscovery is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Italian Renaissance, and for the founding of Renaissance humanism.", "langs": ["fr", "id", "sq"], "links": ["Cicero", "Personal_life_of_Cicero", "Political_career_of_Cicero"]}, "Suzuki_Kisabur\u014d": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzuki_Kisabur\u014d", "ID": "1164274", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Kisabur\u014d", "gender": "M", "name": "[' suzuki kisabur\u014d ']", "birthDate": "[' 1867-11-06 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1940-06-24 ']", "occupation": "[' cabinet minister politician ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "Suzuki Kisabur\u014d  (\u9234\u6728\u559c\u4e09\u90ce, 6 November 1867 \u2013 24 June 1940) was a statesman, politician, judge, prosecutor, educator and cabinet minister in Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa period Japan.", "langs": ["de", "fr", "ja"], "links": ["Yamamoto_Tatsuo_(politician)"]}, "John_J._Hardin": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_J._Hardin", "ID": "1164389", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Hardin", "gender": "M", "name": "[' john j hardin ', ' hardin john j ']", "birthDate": "[' 1810-01-06 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1847-02-23 ']", "occupation": "[' politician colonel ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "summary": "John Jay Hardin (January 6, 1810 \u2013 February 23, 1847) was a U.S. Representative and militia general from Illinois.", "langs": ["arz", "de"], "links": []}, "Miguel_Samper_Agudelo": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miguel_Samper_Agudelo", "ID": "1165107", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Samper_Agudelo", "gender": "M", "name": "[' miguel samper agudelo ', ' samper agudelo miguel ']", "birthDate": "[' 1825-10-24 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1899-03-16 ']", "occupation": "[' lawyer ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' colombians ']", "party": "NA", "summary": "Miguel Samper Agudelo (24 October 1825 \u2013 16 March 1899) was a Colombian lawyer, politician, and writer.
