He began his artistic career as a painter influenced by the Spanish painter Joan Pon\u00e7, with whom he founded the group \u201cL\u00b4Espai\u201d in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1960. He later became interested in photography, cinema and theatre, at the beginning of the seventies began to write experimental fiction and produce and direct animation cinema in Super8 and 16mm.\nIn 1981 founded Videcom, a video production house in S\u00e3o Paulo directed for corporate and cultural audiovisual productions.\nIt was not until 1982 that he began to work in holography, using artisanal methods. He completed and perfected his technique in 1983 after a holography workshop with the German artist Dieter Jung (artist). In the same year he had his first holographic exhibition at the Museu da Imagem e do Som (MIS) in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1984 he developed a specific holographic technique for chromatic control and began the regular production of technically very elaborate works.\nAt that time in his holographic studio he began the production of commercial holograms as well as artistic works.\nIn some of his projects in this field he worked in collaboration with other Brazilian artists and poets interested in holography (Augusto de Campos, D\u00e9cio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and Jos\u00e9 Wagner Garcia). The results of such collaboration were shown in exhibitions in Brazil such as the \u201cTriluz\u201d exhibition (1986) in the Museu da Imagem e do Som, and at the \u201cIdehologia\u201d exhibition (1987) in the Museu de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea, both in S\u00e3o Paulo, and also abroad in Spain and Portugal at the Calouste Gulbekian Foundation (Triluz Portugal) amongst others.\nWith Jos\u00e9 Wagner Garcia he created the prototype of a holographic cinema projector a \"Holographic Kinetoscope\".\nA year after his death a retrospective of his cinema and video works was held at the 9th International \u201cVideobrasil\u201d Festival - 1992 in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nHolographic poems by Augusto de Campos and produced by Baumstein were purchased by the \"Centre R\u00e9gional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie\" in France and in 2007, the holographic poem REVER was exhibited at the exhibition \"Concrete Poetry - O Projeto Verbivocovisual\" in Tomie Ohtake Institute (S\u00e3o Paulo) and at the Pal\u00e1cio das Artes (Belo Horizonte).\nVidecom kept the activities of his holographic laboratory until 2007 when all the equipment was donated to the Optical Lab from the University of Campinas Physics Institute under the responsibility of Prof. Jose Lunazzi.\nBetween September and November 2010 his holograms were presented at the exhibition \"TEKHNE\" (Tekhne page in English/Portuguese and Spanish) at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) in S\u00e3o Paulo, which introduced the discussion of the importance of the convergence between art and technology.", "langs": ["arz", "es", "he", "it", "pt"]}, "Julie_Atlas_Muz": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julie_Atlas_Muz", "ID": "37345", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Atlas_Muz", "gender": "F", "name": "[' julie atlas muz ', ' muz julie atlas ']", "birthDate": "[' 1973-05-30 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' performance art ', ' erotic dance ', ' actor ', ' performance artistburlesque danceractress stage director ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Julie Atlas Muz (born Julie Ann Muz on May 30, 1973) is a New York City-based performance artist, dancer, burlesque artist, stage director, and actress.

There, she was allowed to join a select group of women studying ancient cultures of the world and the old ways. Chakraverti studied with them for three years and finally chose Wicca as her religion. After coming back to India and getting married, Chakraverti declared herself as a witch in 1986. Amidst the backlash that followed her declaration, Chakraverti explained to the media the Neo Pagan ways of Wicca and its healing power.\nChakraverti started administering Wiccan ways of healing to the people of India, including traveling to remote villages and teaching the Wiccan way to the female population, several of whom were often accused of black magic and \"witchcraft\" by male folk, and murdered. In 1998, Chakraverti campaigned as an Indian National Congress candidate for the Parliament of India in the Hooghly district, but was not elected. She released her autobiography Beloved Witch in 2003. A second book titled Sacred Evil: Encounters With the Unknown was released in 2006, and it chronicled nine case studies during her life as a Wiccan healer and explained why those events happened. Both books received positive critical acclaim.\nThe book, Sacred Evil was made into a motion picture by Sahara One Pictures. Titled Sacred Evil \u2013 A True Story, the film starred Bollywood actress Sarika playing Chakraverti.  The film was a commercial disappointment but received mixed reviews. Chakraverti started the Wiccan Brigade, a platform for those who wanted to study Wicca. Later, Bengali TV channel ETV Bangla, created two tele-serials based on Chakraverti's life and her experience with the paranormal.

Later in his life Popescu-Gopo confessed that he tried to start an \"anti-Disney rebellion\". Unable to surpass Disney's animation characters in color and beauty, Popescu-Gopo tried to be more profound in message and substance and simplify the form and techniques used. Unlike Disney's cartoon characters, Popescu-Gopo's cartoon characters were black and white, designed in simple lines.\nIon Popescu-Gopo died in Bucharest on 29 November 1989, just weeks before the Romanian Revolution.

Born in San Jose, California, USA, Murray was interested in a career in the arts when he was three. He credits his high school art teacher Mark Briggs with teaching him a lot about art. Murray was a political cartoonist for a newspaper, often targeting then-President Jimmy Carter. As a young adult Murray was hired as a designer at an agency, where he invested his earnings from the production company into independent animated films. In 1981 at age 20, he founded his independent illustration production company called Joe Murray Studios while he was still in college.\nLater in 1992, Murray created his first animated short film in color called My Dog Zero, after which he decided to develop a television series titled Rocko's Modern Life for Nickelodeon. After pitching it to Nickelodeon, the company decided to create the concept. While creating the series, Murray hired comedian and actor Carlos Alazraqui to supply the voice for the character of Rocko. The series premiered on Nickelodeon on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, completing four seasons and 52 episodes. After Rocko's Modern Life, in 2004, Murray wanted to create another television series, this time for Cartoon Network. He created his second series Camp Lazlo as a pilot, where he served as the producer of that pilot. After Cartoon Network decided to create the show, Murray brought fellow Rocko cast members Carlos Alazraqui, Tom Kenny (who, post-Rocko, became known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) and Mr. Lawrence to voice the main characters Lazlo (Alazraqui), Scoutmaster Lumpus (Kenny) and Edward (Lawrence).

By 2002, Hamasaki had earned the nickname \"Empress of J-pop\" due to her popularity in Japan and throughout Asia, as well as being referred to as \"the voice of the lost generation\". Due to her success and relevance throughout her career, she is considered one of the top solo female artists of the Heisei era for her influence on the music industry and various fashion trends.Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at 14 in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting. In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single \"Poker Face\" and debut major-label album A Song for \u00d7\u00d7. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. This rapid rise to fame is typically attributed to her insightful style of lyric-writing in contrast to her young age; this would continue to be a defining aspect of her work, listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in Japan. It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label's income.After A Best, Hamasaki went on to experiment with her music style and lyricism, incorporating English into her work from Rainbow onwards. Later albums would range from electronic dream-pop to rock genres, with Hamasaki herself saying she does not feel tied to follow music trends, instead focusing on what she enjoys and wants to create \"whether it is trendy or not\". This perspective would continue to resonate with the public throughout her career, with her albums consistently placing in the top ten of the Oricon charts to present day; she currently holds the record for the most albums to place in the top ten by a female artist in Japan, with 54 of her releases reaching that distinction.Hamasaki has sold over 60.94 million units as of 2019, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist in history. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (25), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is also the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon, and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut.

He was the founder of a new religious movement known as Adidam.\nAdi Da initially became known in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks and for the activities of his religious community. He authored more than 75 books, including those published posthumously, with key works including an autobiography, The Knee Of Listening, spiritual works such as The Aletheon and The Dawn Horse Testament, and social philosophy such as Not-Two Is Peace.Adi Da's teaching is closely related to the Indian tradition of nondualism.:\u200a197\u200a He taught that the 'ego'\u2014the presumption of a separate self\u2014is an illusion, and that all efforts to \"attain\" enlightenment or unity with the divine from that point-of-view are necessarily futile. Reality or Truth, he said, is \"always already the case\"::\u200a198\u200a it cannot be found through any form of seeking, it can only be \"realized\" through transcendence of the illusions of separate self in the devotional relationship to the already-realized being. Distinguishing his teaching from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared that he was a uniquely historic avatar and that the practice of devotional recognition-response to him, in conjunction with most fundamental self-understanding, was the sole means of awakening to seventh stage spiritual enlightenment for others.:\u200a99\u200a Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa reportedly remarked that \"[i]t is tremendously difficult to begin a new tradition\" of spirituality, as Adi Da had done.Adi Da founded a publishing house, the Dawn Horse Press, to print his books. He was praised by authorities in spirituality, philosophy, sociology, literature, and art, but was also criticized for what were perceived as his isolation and controversial behavior. In 1985, former followers made allegations of misconduct: two lawsuits were filed, to which Adidam responded with threats of counter-litigation. The principal lawsuit was dismissed and the other was settled out of court.\nIn his later years, Adi Da focused on creating works of art intended to enable viewers to enter into a \"space\" beyond limited \"points of view\". He was invited to the 2007 Venice Biennale to participate through an official collateral exhibition, and was later invited to exhibit his work in Florence, Italy, in the 15th century Cenacolo di Ognissanti and the Bargello museum.

Kotulsky also documented the lives of street people, and that collection of photos has been donated to the City of Toronto archives, which organized a gallery show, to celebrate their acquisition, and subsequently made them available for download.Kotulsky was born to Maria and Mykyta Kotulsky while his family was interned in a Nazi slave labour camp near Cologne, Germany, in the final months of World War II, during an Allied bombing raid. In 1949, after having lived for four years as refugees in a Displaced Persons' camp, his family immigrated to Canada, sponsored by a blacksmith in Smoky Lake, Alberta. By 1951, his family had relocated to Toronto's Cabbagetown, near the Don Valley ravine, which provided a slice of nature in downtown Toronto for Ivaan to explore. Kotulsky would later credit his exposure to the kindly blacksmith as having kindled his own interest in metalworking which found its outlet in jewellery making, at the age of 25.\nKotulsky was said to have been able to see beauty in things people ordinarily overlook, explaining the quality of the intimate images he took of street people. The engagement ring with which he proposed to his wife featured a very large green stone\u2014which was originally a discarded piece of Seven Up bottle. Never in robust health, Ivaan suffered two heart attacks in the early 1990s.  In 1995, Kotulsky opened a retail store on Queen Street West.  That year, he and Eya Donald Greenland were married. They had first met in 1969; she was 16 and working after school at the Harbord Bakery, which he frequented. In 2000, Kotulsky experienced the first of a series of strokes that eventually led to his paralysis and affected his ability to create new works of art.In 2005, after his third stroke, when he lacked the strength and dexterity to continue working independently, Eya started to assist him in his studio, often working with his original moulds, using the lost wax casting technique.  She told Nicole Baute, writing in the Toronto Star, that she never intended to continue making pieces from those moulds after he died, beyond filling the outstanding orders, but customers continued to request pieces.  The Art Gallery of Ontario, which had commissioned Kotulsky in 1979 to create a collection of jewellery and metal art inspired by King Tutankhamun, hosted a long-running exhibition of King Tutankhamun artefacts in 2009, and requested she produce additional reproductions of his work for display in the AGO Shop.  Ivaan's wife, Eya, continued to operate his studio, ATELIER IVAAN, to showcase and preserve his artistic legacy until December, 2018.\nBaute reported that Kotulsky became the \"first Canadian to undergo a pioneering neurosurgical procedure\", to close off the damaged artery that had led to his four strokes.\nShe reported that the surgery closed off the artery, but that during surgery, Kotulsky suffered a fifth stroke that left him in a coma from which he never regained consciousness.

His perspective comes from his experiences as a propaganda poster painter in the PLA and propaganda officer in a transport company, then later from the outside looking back in as a student demonstrator during the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989.His art also explores common themes and approaches in both Chinese propaganda and Western propaganda.", "langs": []}, "James_Falk": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Falk", "ID": "333306", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Falk", "gender": "M", "name": "[' james falk ', ' falk james ']", "birthDate": "[' 1954-05-01 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' research scientist conceptual engineer technological artist inventor and us patent consultant ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "James Falk (born May 1, 1954) is a research scientist, conceptual engineer, technological artist, inventor and U.S Patent consultant.

Wallenda walked 1,800 feet (550 m) on a steel cable over Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua, his longest walk, on March 4, 2020.\nWallenda is a 7th-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family, and he participated in various circus acts as a child. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at the age of 13, and he chose high-wire walking as his career in 1998 after joining family members in a seven-person pyramid on the wire. In 2001, he was part of the world's first eight-person high-wire pyramid. He performed with his family at various venues from 2002 to 2005, forming his own troupe in 2005. He performed with Bello Nock in 2007 and 2008 in a double version of the Wheel of Steel that he helped invent. In 2009, he set new personal bests for highest and longest tightrope walks, completing a total of 15 walks above 100 feet (30 m) in the air that year.\nIn 2008, while performing with Ringling Bros., Wallenda set Guinness World Records for longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire 250-foot-long (76 m) at 135 feet (41 m) above the ground in New Jersey. He nearly doubled the height record in 2010 to 260 feet (79 m). On the same day in 2010, he upped his personal best by tightrope walking over 2,000 feet (610 m) in a single performance. He set a world record in 2011 by performing on the Wheel of Death atop the 23 story Tropicana Casino and Resort. Later that year, he and his mother tightrope walked between the two towers of Condado Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico. The feat was a re-creation of the one that killed Karl Wallenda, Nik's great-grandfather and primary source of inspiration. On June 10, 2011, Wallenda hung from a helicopter 250 feet (76 m) off the ground using only his toes to hold on. Some time after that, he walked on top of a turning Ferris wheel at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, CA.\nWallenda crossed Niagara Falls on June 15, 2012 on a live ABC special, following a two-year legal battle involving both sides of the Canada\u2013United States border to gain approval. He was required to wear a safety harness for the first time in his life. A reality show aired on the Science Channel which followed his feats. In 2013, he released a memoir entitled Balance. He became the first person to high-wire walk across the Grand Canyon on June 23, 2013. The feat aired live on the Discovery Channel breaking rating records for the network. He followed that up with Skyscraper Live, a live Discovery special that aired on November 2, 2014, in which he completed two tightrope walks and set two new Guinness World Records: one for walking the steepest tightrope incline over 600 feet (180 m) up between two skyscrapers, and the other for the highest tightrope walk while blindfolded.\nWallenda is married with three children, and considers his Christian faith to be a central aspect of his life.", "langs": ["bcl", "de", "es", "fr", "it", "ja", "kn", "ml", "nl", "ru", "simple", "ta", "te", "zh"]}, "Timothy_D._Bellavia": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timothy_D._Bellavia", "ID": "358943", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_D._Bellavia", "gender": "M", "name": "[' timothy david bellavia ', ' bellavia timothy david ']", "birthDate": "[' 1971-05-01 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' author illustrator educator producer dancer performance artist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Timothy Bellavia (born 1971) is an American children's author, fabric artist and educator.

A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\nBorn in Tokyo City in the Empire of Japan, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978). He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature film The Castle of Cagliostro as well as the television series Sherlock Hound. In the same period, he also began writing and illustrating the manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1982\u20131994), and he also directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.\nMiyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). The films were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film ever to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films\u2014Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)\u2014also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned in 2016 to work on the upcoming feature film How Do You Live? (2023).\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.", "langs": ["af", "an", "ar", "arz", "ast", "az", "bcl", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "br", "bug", "ca", "cdo", "ceb", "ckb", "cs", "cy", "da", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "gl", "he", "hr", "hu", "hy", "ia", "id", "ilo", "it", "ja", "ka", "kk", "ko", "ky", "la", "lb", "lij", "lt", "lv", "mg", "mk", "ml", "mn", "ms", "myv", "nah", "nds", "nl", "nb", "oc", "pcd", "pl", "pt", "ro", "ru", "sah", "sc", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sr", "sv", "te", "tg", "th", "tl", "tr", "tt", "tyv", "ug", "uk", "uz", "vep", "vi", "wa", "war", "wuu", "zh", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue"]}, "Monte_Westmore": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monte_Westmore", "ID": "369507", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Westmore", "gender": "M", "name": "[' monte westmore ', ' westmore monte ']", "birthDate": "[' 1902-07-22 ']", "deathDate": "[' 1940-03-30 ']", "occupation": "[' make-up artist ', ' make-up artist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": ["Bud_Westmore", "Michael_Westmore", "Perc_Westmore"], "summary": "Montague \"Monte\" Westmore (22 July 1902 \u2013 30 March 1940) was a Hollywood make-up artist, the eldest of six sons of George Westmore.

Her pioneering work was central to the development of the widely influential French New Wave film movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Her films focused on achieving documentary realism, addressing women's issues, and other social commentary, with a distinctive experimental style.Varda's work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of landscapes, rather than outdoors, on location. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional for 1950s French cinema. Varda's feature film debut was La Pointe Courte (1955), followed by Cl\u00e9o from 5 to 7 (1962), one of her most notable narrative films, Vagabond (1985), and Kung Fu Master (1988). Varda was also known for her work as a documentarian with such works as Black Panthers (1968), The Gleaners and I (2000), The Beaches of Agn\u00e8s (2008), Faces Places (2017), and her final film, Varda by Agn\u00e8s (2019).\nDirector Martin Scorsese described Varda as \"one of the Gods of Cinema\". Among several other accolades, Varda received an Honorary Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first woman to win the award, a Golden Lion for Vagabond at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, an Academy Honorary Award, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for Faces Places, becoming the oldest person to be nominated for a competitive Oscar.

She remained active in that world until her debut in 1993 with the short story Fuyu ga Owarou Toshiteita (Winter Was Ending) that ran in Shogakukan's magazine, Puchi Comic.\nIn 2008, her gender bender psychological thriller After School Nightmare won her some of the acclaim she has back home after the Young Adult Library Services Association named it one of the best graphic novels for teenagers. The same work was also nominated for the 2007 Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material (Japan).Though her current drawing style is high in aesthetic value, her earlier works had less finesse. Regardless, her popularity grew largely due to her storytelling. Her works are noted for their slightly askew plots and exploration of the human psyche. Even her lighthearted Sh\u014djo works usually have darker underlying elements. X-Day follows a group of teens whose mounting stress during senior year finals culminates in a plan to blow up their high school; the author has indicated that the series was written in response to the Columbine High School massacre. In her After School Nightmare series, she explores both sexual and gender identity issues. After was so successful in France that the French publisher released an exact replica of the key in the series as a limited edition gift. This led to a fierce online bidding war amongst Japanese fans, with the keys selling for outrageous prices.In 2006 she released The Cornered Mouse Dreams of Cheese. Keiko Takemiya, professor of Kyoto Seika University and one of the members of the Year 24 Group, called it one of the best work published of the BL genre, despite the S&M theme. Widespread success has also followed critical acclaim with many readers rating the work five stars out of a possible 5 on Amazon.jp.Her series Shitsuren Shokoratie (\u5931\u604b\u30b7\u30e7\u30b3\u30e9\u30c6\u30a3\u30a8, Heartbroken Chocolatier) was awarded in May 2012 with the 36th Kodansha Manga Award in the category Sh\u014djo.Her works largely involve the individual's search for authenticity, self-knowledge and personal identity, themes that mirror her favourite author Hermann Hesse's works.

April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana. Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock. He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians.\nCobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge. After signing with DGC Records, Nirvana found commercial success with the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991). Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public. In addition to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", \"In Bloom\", \"Something in the Way\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"All Apologies\", \"About a Girl\", \"Aneurysm\", and \"You Know You're Right\".During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with a heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician Courtney Love. In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and he subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 27; police concluded he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.\nCobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, in their first year of eligibility in 2014. Rolling Stone included Cobain in its lists of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, 100 Greatest Guitarists, and 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. He was ranked 7th by MTV in the \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\". In 2006, he was placed 20th by Hit Parader on their list of the \"100 Greatest Metal Singers of All Time\".", "langs": ["af", "an", "ar", "arz", "ast", "az", "azb", "bar", "bcl", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bn", "br", "bs", "ca", "cs", "cy", "da", "de", "diq", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fr", "fy", "ga", "gl", "got", "he", "hi", "hr", "hu", "hy", "ia", "id", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "jv", "ka", "kk", "km", "kn", "ko", "kw", "la", "lo", "lt", "lv", "mk", "ml", "mn", "ms", "my", "ne", "nl", "nn", "nb", "oc", "pcd", "pdc", "pl", "pms", "pt", "qu", "ro", "ru", "sco", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sq", "sr", "stq", "su", "sv", "szl", "ta", "th", "tr", "tt", "uk", "uz", "vi", "war", "wuu", "zh", "zh-yue"]}, "Nakaba_Suzuki": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nakaba_Suzuki", "ID": "520055", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakaba_Suzuki", "gender": "M", "name": "[' nakaba suzuki ', ' suzuki nakaba ']", "birthDate": "[' 1977-02-08 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' mangaka ', ' manga artist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": ["Akira_Toriyama", "Hajime_Isayama", "Hiro_Mashima", "Ken_Akamatsu", "Oh!_great"], "summary": "Nakaba Suzuki (Japanese: \u9234\u6728\u592e, Hepburn: Suzuki Nakaba, born February 8, 1977) is a Japanese manga artist.

He was born in Herseaux, Belgium. When he was 16, he enrolled in decorative art at Saint-Luc de Tournai. He finished his studies in 1951 with the greatest distinction. He returned as a teacher two years later.\nThe Belgian publisher La Procure \u00e0 Namur organised a drawing contest. They were interested in finding talented artists to illustrate works for school children. Marlier won the competition. Two books resulted from this and these books guided a whole generation of Belgian children through the first few years of school, I Read with Michel and Nicole and I Calculate with Michel and Nicole. Marlier's collaboration with La Procure \u00e0 Namur lasted more than 25 years.\nPierre Servais at Casterman, a Belgian publishing company, began to notice Marlier's drawings in 1951. He suggested that Marlier should illustrate a series of books for children. The result was editions of Alexandre Dumas' adventure books. This was followed in 1953 by illustrations for a book by Jeanne Cappe about two very similar rabbits. Marlier also took part in the Farandole series, intended for children. \nFrom 1954, Marlier illustrated the children's series Martine, with the stories written by Gilbert Delahaye. This series spans over 50 issues and has been translated in numerous languages.\nIn 1969 Marlier also created his own series of children's books, Jean-Lou and Sophie.\nHe died in Tournai on 18 January 2011.\n\n\n== References ==", "langs": ["fr", "ja", "nl", "pl"]}, "Cevin_Soling": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cevin_Soling", "ID": "543734", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cevin_Soling", "gender": "M", "name": "[' cevin soling ', ' soling cevin ']", "birthDate": "[' 1966-08-05 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' philosopher ', ' record producer ', ' artist ', ' musician ', ' writer ', ' filmmaking ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Cevin Soling is an American writer, filmmaker, philosopher, musician, music producer, and artist.\nSoling writes articles and books in addition to producing documentaries, animations, short films, and feature films that engage in social critique.

For Divine's wedding scene in the film, Smith designed a see-through wedding dress for the 300 lb. bride.\nSmith went on to create the look for the grotesque citizens of Mortville in Desperate Living (1977).

His lifelong motto (which he inscribed on the fly leaf of many a volume of his childhood library) was \"ars longa, vita brevis\"  \"art is never ending, life is short\" which he may have first seen in the bell tower of Lavenham Church, and following his wish was also carved on his tombstone in Lavenham cemetery.\nHe had a picture exhibited at Bury St Edmunds  while still at school and his drawings were currency for him at school when he swapped them with class mates for cigarette cards and other items.   He had his first One Man Exhibition in 1948 at the Guildhall, Lavenham.\nHe left school at 14 years of age but continued to spend his spare time drawing and painting.  He worked in a local electrical shop and during the war Durrant joined the Suffolk Regiment (1944 to 1947).  After the war he secured a place at Camberwell College of Arts where he was taught by amongst others by  Edward Ardizzone Michael Rothenstein Keith Vaughan and  John Buckland Wright. and was a contemporary of Theodore Mendez. Whilst at Camberwell he was already exhibiting his paintings in London galleries.   His work moved from early landscape and architectural interest to abstraction but with a great variety of style and technique.\nIn 1963 he moved to Cambridge to take up the post of Art Gallery Manager at Heffers at the time a well known local artists' materials and book sellers.

That was total creative excess. [...] The entire room was covered with paint splatters, and the dried paint sludge lay inches high on the floor.\u201d\nShortly before his first major exhibition together with Schilling, he was conscripted into the military in May 1961. After completing his military service, he fell into a psychological crisis and did not start work again until the end of 1962. In 1964, Brus performed his first \"Aktion\" titled Ana, in which he painted his wife Anni Brus, his own body, and the surroundings of his studio with white and black paint. Throughout the latter half of the 1960s he staged numerous performances with his own body at the center of the action, as in the actions Selbstbemalung and Selbstverst\u00fcmmelung.\nHe was a co-founder in 1964 of Viennese Actionism (German: Wiener Aktionismus with Otto Muehl, Hermann Nitsch, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler. His aggressively presented actionism intentionally disregarded conventions and taboos, with the intent of shocking the viewer. At the Kunst und Revolution event at the University of Vienna in 1968, Brus urinated into a glass then proceeded to cover his body in his own excrement, and  During the performance Brus also sang the Austrian National Anthem while masturbating. Brus ended the piece by drinking his own urine and inducing vomiting, and was subsequently arrested. Through this piece and his other performance works, Brus hoped to reveal the still fascist essence of the nation. This performance created a public outrage at the time and the participants were dubbed by the media as uniferkel or \"University Piggies.\" Sentenced to 6 months in prison after the event and subsequent public reactions, he fled to Berlin with his family and returned to Austria in 1976. Brus also was editor of the Die Schastrommel (author's edition) from 1969 on. He was involved in the NO!Art movement.\nIn 1966 he participated in the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) in London with fellow artists Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Yoko Ono, and others .G\u00fcnter Brus participated in Documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972 and was represented as an artist at Documenta 6 (1977) and Documenta 7 in 1982. From 1970 he began on his novel Irrwisch, which was underpinned by numerous drawings. Works emerged that he calls picture poems which opened a new section in Brus's work, the fruit of which is the rich graphic and literary work of the 1970s and 1980s.\nBrus was awarded the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1996. Most of his works are shocking and controversial. The Joanneum now houses a permanent gallery, called the Bruseum, featuring the work of Brus and fellow Viennese Actionists.\nBrus has been a columnist and illustrator for the Austrian monthly magazine Datum since summer 2005. He lives and works in Graz and on the Canary Islands.\nKurt Flecker, then cultural advisor for Styria, laid the foundation stone for his own Brus Museum in 2008 with a collection purchase for the Neue Galerie Graz. The \"BRUSEUM\", which opened on November 26, 2011 at the new location of the Neue Galerie Graz in the Joanneumsviertel, is designed as a permanent high-profile exhibition space. It is dedicated to the preservation of central works of the artist.\nIn 2010, Berlin-based art film home video company Edition Kr\u00f6thenhayn released a boxset including a DVD containing his films (including, inter alia, 8/64: Ana \u2013 Aktion Brus, 10c/65: Brus w\u00fcnscht euch seine Weihnachten, 10b/65: Silber \u2013 Aktion Brus, 10/65: Selbstverst\u00fcmmelung, 16/67: 20.

The boxset also sports a 100-pages book with photos and texts by Peter Weibel and Theo Altenberg.His wife Ana played an essential role in Brus' work. In a newspaper interview in 2018, she said that she took part in Rudolf Schwarzkogler's \"Wedding\" campaign because Schwarzkogler's wife would never have been willing to show her breasts and Schwarzkogler was too shy to ask a woman. In addition, she once obtained 40 condoms from a pharmacy for an action from Hermann Nitsch because Nitsch did not dare to buy them himself.", "langs": ["arz", "cs", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "fr", "hu", "hy", "it", "nl", "pl", "ru", "sv"]}, "Mickey_Hardt": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mickey_Hardt", "ID": "639743", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Hardt", "gender": "M", "name": "[' mickey hardt ', ' hardt mickey ']", "birthDate": "[' 1969-03-27 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' model actor martial artist ']", "nationality": "[' luxembourg ']", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Mickey Hardt (born March 27, 1969) is an actor, model and martial artist born in Switzerland.

The couple used their honeymoon as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War. She and Lennon remained married until he was murdered in front of the couple's apartment building, the Dakota, on 8 December 1980.

She achieved commercial and critical success in 1980 with the chart-topping album Double Fantasy, a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder, winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. To date, she has had twelve number one singles on the US Dance charts, and in 2016 was named the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time by Billboard magazine.

She funded the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan's Central Park, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan (which closed in 2010).

Often regarded as one of the most prolific athletes in the world, Lesnar is the only person to have won all of the primary heavyweight championships in WWE, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC),  New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).Lesnar competed in collegiate wrestling for the University of Minnesota, winning the NCAA Division I national championship in 2000. He soon signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed WWE in 2002), rising to industry prominence in 2002 by winning the WWE Championship at age 25, setting the record for the youngest performer to win the championship. In 2004, Lesnar departed WWE to join the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL), but was cut from the team during pre-season. He returned to pro-wrestling and signed with NJPW in 2005 where he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Years later in 2012, he re-signed with WWE; his 504-day first reign with the WWE Universal Championship is the seventh-longest world championship reign in the promotion's history and he holds the record for most reigns as Universal Champion at three. He also won the Royal Rumble match twice (2003 and 2022), the Money in the Bank ladder match (2019), the King of the Ring tournament (2002), and has headlined several pay-per-view events, including WWE's flagship event WrestleMania five times (XIX, 31, 34, 36, and 38); in addition, he also ended The Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak in 2014.\nLesnar began an MMA career in 2007, and signed with the UFC in 2008. He quickly won the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but was sidelined with diverticulitis in 2009. On his return in 2010, Lesnar defeated Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion Shane Carwin to unify the heavyweight championships and become the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion. After a set of losses and further struggles with diverticulitis, Lesnar retired from MMA in 2011. He returned at UFC 200 in 2016 to defeat Mark Hunt, but his victory was overturned to a no-contest after he tested positive for clomiphene, a banned substance on UFC's anti-doping policy. He then retired from MMA for the second time in 2017. A box office sensation, he competed in some of the bestselling pay-per-view events in promotion history, including headlining UFC 91, UFC 100, UFC 116, and UFC 121.

He finished high school in Seattle at Lincoln High, then entered the University of Washington. After a short UW student career, in 1923 he enrolled in the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines. He received a degree in mining engineering in 1927.\nAfter graduation, he worked with the Mount McKinley Tourist and Transportation Company and was active in the Mount McKinley Tourist Organization, putting the mountain on the map as a tourist attraction as early as the late 1920s. In 1932 he was elected to the Alaska Territorial Legislature from Fairbanks as a representative of the 4th district; he was 31 at the time, the youngest man ever elected to the House and the first AAC&SM graduate to hold public office. He served two terms in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives.\nIn 1934, he was appointed to the AAC&SM Board of Trustees. The following year, the Territorial Legislature, thanks in part to Lingo's efforts, changed the name of AAC&SM to the University of Alaska, and the Board of Trustees to the Board of Regents. He continued on the Board until 1943.\nOn May 15, 1935, he married Dorothy Minerva (Troy) Morgan, the younger daughter of then Governor John Weir Troy, in the Alaska Governor's Mansion in Juneau; they honeymooned in Mount McKinley Park. In September they moved to Anchorage, where he served as registrar and receiver in the U.S. Land Office, Third Division.\nShortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Lingo enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to Naval Intelligence in Sitka. He retired from the Navy at the end of World War II in 1945 as a commander and moved back to Anchorage. He was a registered guide, worked on a tugboat in Southeastern Alaska, traveled by dogsled in interior Alaska, mined for gold all over Alaska, and built the first golf course in Anchorage.\nLingo ran for the Alaska Territorial Senate in 1954 as an independent candidate. He received only 895 votes out of a total of 22,177 cast for the two seats available in that election. The Democrats won both seats, defeating a Republican incumbent, Wasilla homesteader Gerrit \"Heinie\" Snider in the process.\nIn the 1950s, due to a severe bronchial condition, he and his wife moved to Palm Desert, California. He had counted painters Sydney Laurence and Eustace Ziegler as friends in Alaska, and in California he became active in oil painting, studying with some of the West's finest artists. Avid travelers, the Lingoes traveled twice around the world, and visited 60 countries. He died May 21, 1976, at Saddleback Community Hospital in Laguna Hills, California, after a history of heart trouble.

He was also known simply as Giuseppe Dossena.\n\nHe attended the Brera Academy (Milan) and the Scuola del Castello (Milan), where he formed  strong friendships with  Aligi Sassu, Ernesto Treccani, Guttuso, Domenico Cantatore and Umberto Lilloni. At the Scuola del Castello he won a prize for his sculpture works (a trip to Venice), but his attraction toward color made him choose painting as the medium of artistic communication.\nAlthough his tendency toward impressionism was evident from the beginning, the necessity to provide for his family forced him to dedicate only his spare time to this aspect of the arts. He therefore earned his livelihood for many years with the restoration and the decoration of villas and castles, in addition to producing frescoes for the local churches. In the residences of Pirelli, Falck, Borletti, Invernizzi, Necchi, Toscanini, Count Cicogna, Duke  Gallarati Scotti, and Count Castelbarco, Emilio Giuseppe Dossena decorated, restored and painted large panels with mythological and archaic themes and battles. His works were also in the Italian Embassy in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, but were destroyed by air raids during WWII.\nHis passion for artistic expression allowed him to retain his creative integrity, and he became a sought after impressionist, known for the sensibility of his works as much as for the dynamic strokes which characterized them. His first solo exhibit, at the Galleria Gavioli in Milan (1943), was a success with the critics and the public, and all of the paintings were purchased by collectors.\nThe exhibit at the galleria Hoepli in Milan (1964), and the one at the Palazzo dell\u2019Arredamento, in Desio (1967), also achieved a good response, earning a place on the prestigious Enciclopedia dell\u2019Arte (Edizioni SEDA, Milan).\nUntil the mid-1950s, Dossena signed his paintings GDossena (for Giuseppe Dossena), but the signature mutated in E.G.Dossena after that period.\nAfter the artist lost his studio in a fire, he moved in 1968 to Brooklyn, New York, and resided at 54 Cheever Place in Carroll Gardens and was employed by Studio the Berger, restoring works by Renoir, Rembrandt, Picasso and other masters, property of museums and private collections, among which stand out the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Playboy Club.\nIn New York, the artist temporarily abandoned his impressionist roots, embracing the neo-expressionism, creating shapes more simplified, almost essential, without any schematism or structural restrictions. The shape is almost snatched from nature, in a continued research to contain and interpret the existential essence and express these new inescapable sensations, which the artist feel away from his country.\n\nThe exhibits at the Columbus Citizens Committee (1973) and the Galerie Internationale (1973, 1974) gave unforeseen positive results. Dorothy Hall, art critic of NY Park East magazine, stated: \"These are exuberant works in rich, assertive color, dealing with varied subject matter, both abstract and representational. In either case, there's a feeling of nervous energy bursting forth in the artist's treatment of generously flowered fields, butterflies, still lifes and dancing figures \u2026\u201dMario Albertazzi, the Il Progresso Italo-Americano art critic, added: \"Brilliant colorist, he brings to his canvas the light of nature and the joy of life. His works\u2026are rich in density and at the same time buoyant, restless and gentle as a delicate caress\u2026\"After eight years he returned to Italy, and devoted his time exclusively to painting. He regained his impressionistic tendencies, although with a more aggressive chromatic handling.\n\nDossena exhibited at the Galleria Treves (Spotorno, 1977), Galleria Il Portichetto ( Stresa, 1978) and the Circolo Ambrosiano Meneghin e Cecca (Milan, 1983). The specialized press covered these events profusely, offering only positive comments. The art critic Mario Portalupi affirmed:  \u201cIn truth, his painting process is born out of impressions and the subsequent emotions, which transform reality and regulate the chromatic entities on the canvas\u2026\u201dHis friend Enzo Lepore, renowned opera singer, stated:  \u201cDossena\u2026excels for the luminous harmony of the chromatic contrasts and he distinguishes himself for the expressive purity of his vigorous and original style\u2026 His paintings are fresh, palpitating, and rich with a vast conception and spirituality, in a frame of radiant and intensive colors\u2026\u201dAmong the many honors he received, in 1985 Dossena was awarded the prestigious Ambrogino d\u2019Oro per l\u2019Arte from the City of Milan and in 1989 a ceramic tile with his signature is placed in the famous Muretto di Alassio.\nDossena was a member of numerous academies and artistic associations, among them the  Accademia Tiberina and the Accademia dei Bronzi. In the last years of his life, the artist, ill and unable to paint, devoted himself to poetry, receiving numerous awards and appearing in a variety of literary anthologies.

During the 1970s, she appeared in numerous television series, including recurring roles on Harry O (1974\u20131976), and The Six Million Dollar Man (1974\u20131978) with her then-husband, film and television star Lee Majors. Her iconic red swimsuit poster sold six million copies in its first year in print. Fawcett's breakthrough role was the role of private investigator Jill Munroe in Charlie's Angels, which co-starred Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith. The show propelled all three actresses to stardom. After appearing in the show's first season in 1976, Fawcett decided to leave Charlie's Angels. She later returned as a guest star in six episodes during the show's third and fourth seasons (1978\u20131980). For her work in Charlie's Angels, Fawcett received her first Golden Globe nomination.\nIn 1983, Fawcett received positive reviews for her performance in the Off-Broadway play Extremities. She was subsequently cast in the 1986 film version and received a Golden Globe nomination. She received Emmy Award nominations for her role as a battered wife in The Burning Bed (1984) and for her portrayal of real-life murderer Diane Downs in Small Sacrifices (1989). Her 1980s work in TV movies earned her four additional Golden Globe nominations. Although Fawcett weathered some negative press for a rambling appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in 1997, she garnered strong reviews that year for her role in the film The Apostle with Robert Duvall.

As a filmmaker in his own right he is recognised for creating a loose trilogy of horror films: The Reflecting Skin (1990), The Passion of Darkly Noon (1995) and Heartless (2009) for which he has acquired a cult following.As a playwright he has been described as \"a pioneer of In-yer-face theatre\", which is a style and sensibility of drama that characterised many new plays that were performed in Britain during the 1990s. Ridley's debut play, The Pitchfork Disney (1991), is considered by many to be a seminal work that influenced the development of this form of theatre, with one critic even dubbing it \"the key play\" of the 1990s. A great number of his plays for adults have been perceived as controversial, being met with both condemnation and high acclaim upon their initial reception. As a writer for the stage he is also recognised for creating an ongoing series of plays for young people (The Storyteller Sequence) and has written theatrical works for children and family audiences.As a songwriter he has created songs for his cinematic and theatrical works, frequently collaborating with composer Nick Bic\u00e2t. He and Bic\u00e2t have also formed a music group called Dreamskin Cradle with singer Mary Leay. Ridley has also written songs for composer Anna Meredith, particularly operatic work.Ridley is also a poet, photographer, and performance artist and has written drama for radio.Although Ridley creates stories through a wide range of media, he dislikes his work being categorised by the medium in which it is told, often referring to them belonging to each other as \"different peaks of the same mountain.\"", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "ca", "de", "fa", "fi", "fr", "it", "ru", "sv"]}, "Douglas_Layton": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_Layton", "ID": "756028", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Layton", "gender": "M", "name": "[' douglas layton ', ' layton douglas ']", "birthDate": "[' 1950-11-01 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' manager - consultant - author - artist ']", "nationality": "[' united states ']", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Douglas Layton is the founder of several International humanitarian organizations, an American author, businessman,  and champion of human rights and religious freedom in the Middle East.

His work is concerned with ostension. Underpinning all of his work is an interest in how myth and artifice can shape and alter reality, especially regarding crop circles, UFOlogy, and other examples of urban legends and the paranormal.He was born in London and studied fine art, interactive design, and the creative use of the Internet at Middlesex University (1988\u20131991), University College London (1991\u20131992) and the University of Westminster (1996\u20131997). In the early 1990s he founded Circlemakers, an arts collective dedicated to exploring the phenomenon of crop circles and the role of deception in the process of artistic creation. Lundberg and his collaborators \u2013 including Rod Dickinson, Gavin Turk, Simon Bill, Wil Russell and Rob Irving \u2013 followed after Doug Bower and Dave Chorley in anonymously creating their own crop circles at night. Sometimes treated as not only authentic but as \"significant\" by paranormalists, Lundberg and the Circlemakers' work has been the subject of a BBC documentary and been commissioned by various clients, including the rock band Korn.In 2017 streetwear brand Supreme asked Circlemakers to create a massive crop circle of their Supreme box logo at a secret location in California. The crop circle can be seen in the short film produced by Supreme called Crop Fields.In 1995 Lundberg created the Circlemakers website to document his group's activities. He also coauthored the 2006 book The Field Guide: The Art, History and Philosophy of Crop Circle Making with Rob Irving.\nLundberg and Dickinson have been accused of being behind the Alien Autopsy footage, a charge they deny (although Lundberg is a fan of the film). Circlemakers' activities have also led to Lundberg and his collaborators being threatened with violence and accused of being MI5 recruits.[dubious source?]\nLundberg graduated from the National Film and Television School's Documentary Direction program in 2004, and his graduation film The Mythologist, about UFOlogist Habib Azadehdel, won the Jerwood First Cuts Documentary Award at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival, was shortlisted for the Grierson Awards in the best newcomer category, and was shown on BBC Four.His feature-length documentary Mirage Men, created with Mark Pilkington, Roland Denning and Kypros Kyprianou is about how the US government used mythology to cover up their advanced technology. The film had its world premiere at the 2013 Sheffield Doc/Fest in the UK on 13 June 2013, its North American premiere at the 2013 Fantastic Fest\u200a in Austin, Texas on 22 September 2013, its Australian premiere at the Canberra International Film Festival on 31 October 2013 and its Nordic premiere at the Stockholm Film Festival\u200a in Sweden on 10 November 2013. American novelist Ernest Cline credits the Mirage Men movie as an influence on his novel and screenplay Armada. Mark Pilkington's book about the project, also called Mirage Men, was published in 2010 by Constable & Robinson.Mirage Men has been excerpted in the Adam Curtis documentary HyperNormalisation on BBC iPlayer.He's currently working on his second feature-length documentary Kaufman Lives  about the life, death and legend of Andy Kaufman.\nBesides his Circlemakers and film activities, Lundberg has also been involved with gallery-based art in collaboration with UFOlogists, and was reported to have been enlisted by graffiti artist Banksy to stealth-promote the latter's film Exit Through the Gift Shop.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "pl"]}, "Graham_Nicholls": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Nicholls", "ID": "761301", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Nicholls", "gender": "M", "name": "NA", "birthDate": "[' 1975-07-30 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' author speaker and artist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Graham Nicholls (born 30 July 1975) is a British author, installation artist and specialist on out of body experiences.

His family moved to California's Central Valley where he graduated from Stockton High School in 1948. He attended California College of Arts and Crafts. He served in the United States Army until December 1955 and was stationed at Fort Bliss in Texas.In 1956, Hong became a fashion designer for the growing department store chain Neiman Marcus. For his first major professional assignment Lawrence Marcus asked him to compete in the contest to design Grace Kelly's bridesmaids' gowns for her marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Marcus scouted Monaco's Saint Nicholas Cathedral in a prenuptial visit and provided ideas based upon the building's architecture, decor, and general surroundings, which Hong then worked into the winning design. At only 22 years of age, Grace Kelly chose him to design her bridesmaid's dresses. The bridesmaids carried bouquets of pale pink tea roses. Their gowns were designed by Joseph Hong of Neiman Marcus and were made by Priscilla of Boston. The dresses were made in the bride\u2019s favorite color~ pale yellow (referred to as \u201csunlight\u201d). The top layer of the gown was fashioned from sheer silk organdy and featured a high-necked collar and full bishop sleeves. The fitted bodice had a pleated sash and full skirt that flowed into a short train. The organdy gown was layered over a strapless silk taffeta underdress. The simple bonnet of yellow silk organdy was designed by Joseph Hong and made by Don Marshall. The four flower girls carried a bouquet of daisies. Their dresses were also designed by Joseph Hong and made by Formals by Mary Carter. The top layer was made of white cotton organdy and featured white and yellow daisies that were machine embroidered with silk thread. The dress had sweet puffed sleeves and a collar that was similar in style to the bridesmaid gowns. The underskirt was made of yellow silk taffeta.  A simple wreath of daisies was worn as a headpiece.\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art exhibited these beautiful gowns in 2006 during \"Grace Kelly: Icon of Style to Royal Bride\".\nHong never married and eventually settled in San Francisco, California. His design projects extended far beyond clothing and included posters for the San Francisco Zoo as well as gift boxes for Joseph Magnin Co. Friends said his love of San Francisco and the Italian-influenced North Beach neighborhood was reflected in his art.\nHe also illustrated Helen Corbitt's Cookbook published on January 1, 1957.\nAt his death in 2004, he was survived by three brothers and a sister.\n\n\n== References ==", "langs": ["ar"]}, "Dingdong_Dantes": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dingdong_Dantes", "ID": "784563", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingdong_Dantes", "gender": "M", "name": "[' dingdong dantes ']", "birthDate": "[' 1980-08-02 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' actor ', ' television director ', ' presenter ', ' music artist (occupation) ', ' businessperson ', ' politician ']", "nationality": "[' filipinos ']", "party": "NA", "links": ["Daniel_Padilla", "Judy_Ann_Santos", "Kathryn_Bernardo", "Marian_Rivera", "Robin_Padilla", "Solenn_Heussaff"], "summary": "Jose Sixto Raphael Gonzalez Dantes III (born August 2, 1980), professionally known as Dingdong Dantes (Tagalog: [di\u014b\u02c8d\u0254\u014b d\u0250n\u02c8t\u025bs]), is a Filipino actor, television presenter, dancer, commercial model and film producer who is currently working as an exclusive talent of GMA Network.

She is the recipient of several accolades, including a Cannes Film Festival Award and a Peabody Award, and nominations for a British Academy Film Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards.\nBorn in Texas, Duvall began acting after being discovered by director Robert Altman, who was impressed with her upbeat presence, and cast her in the black comedy film Brewster McCloud (1970). Despite her hesitance towards becoming an actress, she continued to work with Altman, appearing in McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971) and Thieves Like Us (1974). Her breakthrough came with Altman's cult film Nashville (1975), and she earned widespread acclaim with the drama 3 Women (1977), also directed by Altman, for which she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and earned a nomination for the British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. That same year she appeared in a supporting role (as a writer for Rolling Stone) in Woody Allen's satirical romantic comedy Annie Hall (1977) and hosted Saturday Night Live.\nIn the 1980s, Duvall became famous for her leading roles, which include Olive Oyl in Altman's live-active feature version of Popeye (1980) and in Stanley Kubrick's horror film The Shining (1980) as protagonist Wendy Torrance. She appeared in Terry Gilliam's fantasy film Time Bandits (1981), the short comedy horror film Frankenweenie (1984) and the comedy Roxanne (1987).

In the next ten years he made a name for himself in television, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films, notably The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Cool Hand Luke (1967), Hang 'Em High (1968) and True Grit (1969). Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s.Hopper made his directorial film debut with Easy Rider (1969), which he and co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern. The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award for \"Best First Work\" and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (shared with Fonda and Southern). Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion\". Film critic Matthew Hays wrote \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper\".Following the critical and commercial failure of his second film as director, The Last Movie (1971), he worked on various independent and foreign projects \u2013 in which he was frequently typecast as mentally disturbed outsiders in such films as Mad Dog Morgan (1976) and The American Friend (1977) \u2013 until he found new fame for his role as an American photojournalist in Apocalypse Now (1979). He went on to helm his third directorial work Out of the Blue (1980), for which he was again honored at Cannes, and appeared in Rumble Fish, The Osterman Weekend (both 1983), and My Science Project (1985). He saw a career resurgence in 1986 when he was widely acclaimed for his performances in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, the latter of which saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His fourth directorial outing came about through Colors (1988), followed by an Emmy-nominated lead performance in Paris Trout (1991). In 1990, Dennis Hopper directed The Hot Spot, which was not a box-office hit. Hopper found greater fame for portraying the villains of the films Super Mario Bros. (1993), Speed (1994), and Waterworld (1995).\nHopper's later work included a leading role in the short-lived television series Crash (2008\u20132009), inspired by the film of the same name.

They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J. R. R.

This offered a far more complex notion of the cultures of the Pacific Islands than had previously been accepted. Furthermore, he created vivid imagery of Hawaiian culture prior to contact with Europeans, and especially the period of early European influence, that sparked appreciation of a nearly forgotten traditional life.

She is the daughter of filmmaker Karel Zeman.Zeman was born in the Moravian Czech city of Zl\u00edn (renamed Gottwaldov in 1949, through 1989). She graduated from the college of art (St\u0159edn\u00ed um\u011bleckopr\u016fmyslov\u00e1 \u0161kola) in Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b. She worked as her father's assistant for his final films, and married Eugen Sp\u00e1len\u00fd, the chief animator at his studio. They had two children, Linda and Malvinia. She launched a career in story books and animation for children.In 1983, Zeman and her husband were invited to teach film technique at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver. When the couple attempted to emigrate, the Czechoslovakian communist government refused them permission, accusing them of pro-Western leanings. Zeman was told to leave the animation studio, and Sp\u00e1len\u00fd was drafted into menial construction work. In the summer of 1984, the family escaped through Yugoslavia to a refugee camp in Austria, finally arriving in Canada to accept the teaching posts.The Cedar Tree of Life, a thirty-second animated segment the couple produced for the Canadian edition of Sesame Street, attracted the attention of the National Film Board of Canada, which invited the couple to make a short film on a topic of their choice. Zeman's production was Lord of the Sky, based on myths of the Canadian north Pacific First Nations and produced using paper cutouts. The film was a success, winning eleven international awards, including a blue ribbon at the American Film Festival in 1993; it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival the following year and was shortlisted for an Academy Award nomination.Following Lord of the Sky, Zeman and Sp\u00e1len\u00fd planned a feature-length animated film based on the Epic of Gilgamesh. Karel Zeman had introduced the epic, which was among his favorite books, to Ludmila when she was eleven.

In his spare time he also studied at the Slade School and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Among these was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, embarked on a brief affair with Keeler. Most of their assignations took place in Ward's home in Wimpole Mews.\nWard's friendship with the Soviet military attach\u00e9 Yevgeny Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo\u2013Keeler\u2013Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended his relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons but a few weeks later admitted his affair. He resigned from his ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership in the Privy Council. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963, he was charged with prostitution offences and committed for trial.\nIn the trial, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of the prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off the earnings of prostitution. Before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014, the trial verdict was put under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, but in 2017, the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal because the original transcript of the judge's summing up could not be found.", "langs": ["arz", "cy", "de", "fr", "he", "it", "nl", "ru"]}, "Carmindy": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carmindy", "ID": "958418", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmindy", "gender": "F", "name": "[' carmindy ']", "birthDate": "[' 1971-03-26 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' celebrity ', ' celebritymake-up artist ']", "nationality": "[' united states ']", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Carmindy Kathryn Bowyer, better known by her professional name Carmindy, is an American make-up artist and beauty expert based in New York City.

Tobias is best known for creating the Mortal Kombat series along with Ed Boon, to whom he pitched the game concept.Tobias became interested in drawing from an early age, inspired by comic books. During high school he took weekend courses at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was an artist for The Real Ghostbusters comic book series before joining Midway Games. Tobias said his original career plan was to be a comic book artist, but the advances in graphics at the time made the video game industry more appealing to him, as well as his mother frequently stating that artists would never support their families. He worked on the original arcade version of Smash TV (1990) prior to the success of Mortal Kombat in 1992. Tobias created the early Mortal Kombat series' storyline, themes, and settings; including the Outworld and Netherrealm. He was also responsible for the design of the entire character roster from the early games in the series through Mortal Kombat 4 (1997). This includes the series' most popular characters including Kano, Kitana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade, and Goro. Noob Saibot was named after Tobias's and Boon's reversed surnames. This is also elaborated in their Twitter handles, @therealsaibot and @noobde.Tobias, along with other prominent Midway staff members, including Dave Michicich and Josh Tsui, left Midway in 1999 and formed Studio Gigante in 2000. Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus, published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2003, was the first game Studio Gigante created, followed by WWE WrestleMania 21 in 2005. Studio Gigante ceased operations in 2005 and Tobias worked as a consultant in the games industry until September 2012, when he joined social games studio Zynga.Despite being one of the original creators of the Mortal Kombat series, Tobias is not mentioned in commentary or descriptions in the \"making of\" documentaries for Deadly Alliance and Deception, but was referred to as one of \"four people who made\" the original Mortal Kombat. However, he can be seen in the commentaries for Mortal Kombat 3 in the collection Midway Arcade Treasures 2. In 2008, Tobias illustrated a pack-in comic with special editions of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Tobias was interviewed at length in episode 5 of the 2020 Netflix documentary miniseries High Score, about Mortal Kombat and the controversies surrounding its release. As part of the Hispanic Heritage Month 2021 Boon tweeted they both are Hispanic.", "langs": ["ar", "arz", "de", "es", "fa", "fr", "he", "it", "pl", "pt", "ru", "tr", "uk", "vi"]}, "Neil_Forrester": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Forrester", "ID": "979005", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Forrester", "gender": "NA", "name": "[' neil forrester ']", "birthDate": "[' 1971-01-03 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' artist ', ' musician ', ' actor ', ' artistmusicianactor ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Neil A.

He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested he take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film star.\nNorris went on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon Films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running CBS television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2 (1990), The Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The President's Man (2000) and its sequel (2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2 (2012).\nThroughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western fiction, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the \"facts\", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising. The phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them New York Times best sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien where he read the facts or participated in sketches.", "langs": ["af", "an", "ar", "arz", "ast", "az", "azb", "bar", "bat-smg", "be", "be-x-old", "bg", "bi", "bn", "br", "ca", "ckb", "cs", "cv", "da", "de", "el", "eo", "es", "et", "eu", "fa", "fi", "fo", "fr", "ga", "gl", "he", "hr", "hu", "hy", "id", "io", "is", "it", "ja", "ka", "kk", "kn", "ko", "la", "lt", "lv", "mk", "ml", "ms", "nl", "nb", "oc", "olo", "pl", "pt", "qu", "ro", "ru", "scn", "sco", "sh", "simple", "sk", "sl", "sq", "sr", "su", "sv", "sw", "ta", "th", "tr", "uk", "uz", "vec", "vi", "wuu", "xmf", "zh", "zh-min-nan", "zh-yue"]}, "Rajesh_Vedprakash": {"#DBpURL": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rajesh_Vedprakash", "ID": "997875", "WikiURL": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajesh_Vedprakash", "gender": "M", "name": "[' rajesh vedprakash ', ' \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0947\u0936 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936 ', ' vedprakash rajesh ']", "birthDate": "[' 1968-10-07 ']", "deathDate": "NA", "occupation": "[' voice acting ', ' dubbing (filmmaking) ', ' voice actor ', ' dubbing artist ']", "nationality": "NA", "party": "NA", "links": [], "summary": "Rajesh Vedprakash (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0947\u0936 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936, born as Rajesh Vedprakash Maingi \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0947\u0936 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936 \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0917\u0940; October 7, 1968) as an Indian voice artist who can speak English, Hindi and Urdu.

Aside from westerns, like Strongbow the Mohawk, Buffalo Bill and Billy the Kid, he drew WWII aviation strip Battler Britton, historical strips like Dick Turpin, a highwaywoman strip, Black Velvet, for Poppet, and adaptations of Quo Vadis and Last of the Mohicans. He also drew Tales of the Gold Monkey and The Cyclone King for TV Comic, and for Eagle, Playhour and Look and Learn.Over the course of the 1950s and 60s his style became the house style for AP/Fleetway adventure artists.

While often called a \"comedian\", Kaufman preferred to describe himself instead as a \"song and dance man\". He has sometimes been called an \"anti-comedian\". He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in an interview, \"I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.\"After working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s, Kaufman came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975, when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of Saturday Night Live. His Foreign Man character was the basis of his performance as Latka Gravas on the hit television show Taxi from 1978 until 1983. During this time, he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art/comedy shows, sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude lounge singer Tony Clifton. He was also a frequent guest on sketch comedy and late-night talk shows, particularly Late Night with David Letterman. In 1982, Kaufman brought his professional wrestling villain act to Letterman's show by way of a staged encounter with Jerry \"The King\" Lawler of the Continental Wrestling Association.

Best known for his 1970s films El Topo and The Holy Mountain, Jodorowsky has been \"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\" for his work which \"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\".Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Dropping out of college, he became involved in theater and in particular mime, working as a clown before founding his own theater troupe, the Teatro Mimico, in 1947. Moving to Paris in the early 1950s, Jodorowsky studied traditional mime under \u00c9tienne Decroux, and put his miming skills to use in the silent film Les t\u00eates interverties (1957), directed with Saul Gilbert and Ruth Michelly. From 1960 onwards he divided his time between Mexico City and Paris, where he co-founded Panic Movement, a surrealist performance art collective that staged violent and shocking theatrical events. In 1966 he created his first comic strip, Anibal 5, and in 1967 he directed his first feature film, the surrealist Fando y Lis, which caused a huge scandal in Mexico, eventually being banned.\nHis next film, the acid western El Topo (1970), became a hit on the midnight movie circuit in the United States, considered the first-ever midnight cult film, and garnered high praise from John Lennon, who convinced former Beatles manager Allen Klein to provide Jodorowsky with $1 million to finance his next film. The result was The Holy Mountain (1973), a surrealist exploration of western esotericism. Disagreements with Klein, however, led to both The Holy Mountain and El Topo failing to gain widespread distribution, although both became classics on the underground film circuit. After a cancelled attempt at filming Frank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel Dune, Jodorowsky produced five more films: the family film Tusk (1980); the surrealist horror Santa Sangre (1989); the failed blockbuster The Rainbow Thief (1990); and the first two films in a planned five-film autobiographical series The Dance of Reality (2013) and Endless Poetry (2016).\nJodorowsky is also a comic book writer, most notably penning the science fiction series The Incal throughout the 1980s, which has been described as having a claim to be \"the best comic book\" ever written.
